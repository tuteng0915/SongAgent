Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Where we once shared our dreams and feats
Now the silence is all I hear
As memories flood, I hold back tears

[chorus]
We said forever, but it's over now
Love's sweet song turned into sorrow's vow
In this quiet, I'm left with my pain
Wishing for yesterday, but it won't come again

[bridge]
But in the shadows, a figure appears
I thought I saw you the other day, Dad
A fleeting moment, yet so clear
In this solitude, perhaps not all is bad
