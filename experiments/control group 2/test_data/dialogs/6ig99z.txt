Hey there! I’d like you to generate a rock song based on the following requirements:  

- The chorus should repeat a key phrase about three times, and it needs to include something along the lines of "why do you wanna die."  
- It’s sung by a male vocalist with a clean guitar intro—nothing too heavy, no distortion at first—and it builds into a full rock vibe later.  
- Keep it emotional and raw, staying true to rock ballad vibes.  

Can you work your magic and create something that fits this description?

I've created a rock ballad based on your requirements. Here's what I came up with:

- **Tags**: Rock, ballad, emotional, male vocalist, clean guitar, raw, build-up  
- **Lyrics**:

```
[verse]
I saw you standing in the rain last night
Your shadow fading under neon lights
The echoes of your footsteps filled the air
But I could feel there was no one there

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[verse]
There's a fire burning deep inside your soul
But you keep pushing everyone away, losing control
I hear your voice—it's screaming through the pain
But silence answers every time again

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[bridge]
The storm will pass, and skies will clear
But only if you face what brought you here
Hold on tight, don't let go now
This is your fight, take that vow

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[outro]
So let the tears fall down tonight
Let the world feel heavy as you fight
But remember who you used to be
Alive with dreams—just let them free
```

It starts off with a clean guitar intro and builds into an emotional rock anthem, staying true to the raw and heartfelt vibe you requested.
