Hey there! I’m looking for a song that fits a specific vibe, but instead of finding it, I’d love for you to generate one based on these details. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

- The style should be inspired by music from the 90s to mid-2000s.  
- It needs to feature a female vocalist with an ethereal yet groovy tone.  
- Ideally, this could fit perfectly onto a movie soundtrack—something cinematic and emotional but still chill.  
- Bonus points if we can weave in themes or imagery related to “Eden” since that word feels significant here.  

Can you create something like this? Let me know how it turns out!
