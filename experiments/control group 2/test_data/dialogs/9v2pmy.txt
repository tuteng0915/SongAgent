Hey, song generating agent! I need you to craft an alt rock song that gives off tragically hip vibes. The key lyric here is "one in a million," and at some point in the song, it should be repeated with a drawn-out, almost anthemic feel like "one in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on." Let’s capture that raw, edgy energy with a touch of introspection—something that feels both modern and timeless. Can you create this for me?

[verse]
Wandering streets in the shadow of doubt,
Dreams slipping through like whispers devout.
Every face just another disguise,
Hiding the truth in their one in a million lies.

[chorus]
One in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on,
Searching for something that feels so wrong, so gone.
One in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on,
The echoes of silence where hearts have withdrawn.

[verse]
Neon lights paint the city's cold face,
In the crowd, still no place to embrace.
Every moment a fleeting escape,
Running from shadows, from choices misplaced.

[bridge]
But there’s fire in veins, though it flickers and fades,
A spark of rebellion that time cannot tame.
Through the chaos, a whisper of hope remains,
For the one in a million who bear all the pain.

[chorus]
One in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on,
Climbing toward heavens or falling undone.
One in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on,
We’re all just dreamers beneath the same sun.
