Sure thing! Let's get started. Could you tell me more about the theme or message of the song?
Agent : 
Of course! To create a song that truly resonates with you, could you share some details about the theme or message you'd like to convey? For example, do you want it to be uplifting and energetic, or more introspective and mellow? Any specific topics or emotions you'd like to explore in the lyrics?
User : 
I think I'd like it to be uplifting and energetic. Maybe something about chasing dreams or finding hope in tough times. Does that make sense?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
That makes perfect sense! An uplifting and energetic song with themes of chasing dreams and finding hope during tough times can be really powerful. To make sure I capture exactly what you're envisioning, let me gather a bit more information.

### Additional Questions:
1. Are there any specific keywords or phrases you'd like included in the lyrics?
2. Do you prefer a particular genre or style (e.g., pop, rock, electronic)?
3. Should the song have a fast tempo to match the energetic vibe, or something more moderate?

Once I have these details, I'll generate the initial tags and lyrics for you.
User : 
Hmm, I'm not sure about specific keywords, but maybe something about a "bright future" or "clear skies ahead." As for genre, I mentioned acoustic earlier, right? And yeah, a fast tempo would be great!

### Lyrics:

[verse]
Walking through the shadows, I see a light,
Clear skies ahead, shining so bright.
Every step I take, brings me closer to my dreams,
In this journey of life, nothingâ€™s as it seems.

[chorus]
Weâ€™re chasing dreams, reaching for the sky,
With every heartbeat, we learn to fly.
Bright futures ahead, let the past subside,
Together we rise, with hope as our guide.

[verse]
Voices in the wind, whispering to be strong,
Through the toughest days, where we truly belong.
The road is long, but weâ€™ll find our way,
With each new dawn, comes a brighter day.

[chorus]
Weâ€™re chasing dreams, reaching for the sky,
With every heartbeat, we learn to fly.
Bright futures ahead, let the past subside,
Together we rise, with hope as our guide.

[bridge]
Clear skies ahead, no storm can hold us down,
Our spirits unbroken, in this dance we astound.
Lift your eyes, see the world anew,
This is our moment, me and you.
