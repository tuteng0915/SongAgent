Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a very specific vibe. I want it to feel like something from the early/mid 2000s, with a folksy acoustic style. The singer should have a raspy, unpolished voice, and the instrumentation should be minimal—just an acoustic guitar carrying most of the weight.

As for the lyrics, here are some themes I’d love incorporated:
- A strong sense of **nostalgia**, like looking back on simpler times.
- Some kind of reference to **Cuba** or even **Che Guevara**—something that evokes revolutionary spirit or just that cultural aesthetic.
- Mention of **guns**, maybe in a metaphorical way, or tied into the broader themes.
- Something about **sugar cane**—perhaps playing or laying in fields of it, symbolizing warmth, nature, or sweetness mixed with hardship.

Think you can whip up something based on these ideas? Let’s create this song together!
