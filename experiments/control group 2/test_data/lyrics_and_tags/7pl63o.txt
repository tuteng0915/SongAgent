Lyrics :
[verse]
Racing through the night, heart is pounding loud
City lights are blurring, we're breaking through the crowd

[chorus]
We're alive, feel the rush, can't you hear our sound
Together we'll ignite the world, it's our time to astound

[verse]
Underneath the moonlight, shadows start to fade
With every step we're taking, we're not afraid

[chorus]
We're alive, feel the rush, can't you hear our sound
Together we'll ignite the world, it's our time to astound

[bridge]
The rhythm takes control, let it lift you off the ground
Feel the bassline echoing, as we chase the night around

[chorus]
We're alive, feel the rush, can't you hear our sound
Together we'll ignite the world, it's our time to astound
