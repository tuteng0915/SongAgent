Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these streets
Feeling the cold breeze
I know it's time to leave
But something keeps me here

[chorus]
And life is too shorrrt to be afraid forrr youuuu
We'll dance in the rain, let the world fade to blue

[verse]
Memories flash by
Like pages of a book
Each one a little sigh
As I try to take a look

[chorus]
And life is too shorrrt to be afraid forrr youuuu
We'll dance in the rain, let the world fade to blue

[bridge]
In this moment, we're alive
Let the pictures tell our story
Through the autumn, through the sky
We'll find our place in glory
