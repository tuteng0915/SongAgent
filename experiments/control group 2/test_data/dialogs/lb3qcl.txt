Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique challenge for you. Based on the details I'm about to provide, I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of what I'm looking for instead of finding an existing one. Here's what I need:

- The song should feature a repetitive, rustic, mid-range violin line that leans more towards a minor, melancholic tone rather than a major, upbeat one.
- It should be set in the late 90s to early 2000s "adult" pop and alternative style, reminiscent of artists like Lisa Loeb, Paula Cole, and Barenaked Ladies.
- The song ideally includes female vocals, fitting into the laid-back vibe with a prominent violin line akin to "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega but not necessarily electronic or trip-hop.
- The overall sound should capture the "90s" feelâ€”somewhat drab yet catchy enough for radio play.

Could you craft a song that fits this description? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!

I've crafted a song that fits your description based on the details you provided. Here's a summary of what I've done:

- **Tags**: The tags include "violin, female vocals, melancholic, 90s, adult pop, alternative" and references to artists like Lisa Loeb, Paula Cole, Barenaked Ladies, and the style akin to "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega.
  
- **Lyrics**: I have written lyrics that capture the essence of a melancholic, laid-back vibe with themes that fit well within the late 90s to early 2000s "adult" pop and alternative style.

Here are the lyrics:
```
[verse]
Waking up to the sound of rain
Tracing patterns on the window pane
Memories like whispers call my name
In this small and quiet town

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[verse]
Pages turn like leaves in the wind
Every story fades but never ends
I walk these streets, a silent friend
Underneath the gray and watching skies

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[bridge]
And if I could, I'd hold on tight
To moments lost in fading light
But time moves on; it won't be kind
We leave our ghosts behind

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[outro]
The violin weeps as the night grows deep
A tapestry woven in shades of sleep
Tomorrow waits, but here I keep
The echoes of dreams that never truly leap
