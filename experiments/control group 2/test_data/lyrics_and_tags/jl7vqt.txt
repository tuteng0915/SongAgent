Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding the waves where the sun shines bright
Got my guitar, ready to ignite
Three chords in, feeling so alive
This is our moment, we're diving in

[chorus]
The rhythm's high, hearts are on fire
Eyes wide open, chasing the wire
Feel the rush, it's a summer spree
Oh, we're dancing free!

[drum solo]
EY-EY-EY-EY (x4)

[verse]
Flute in the air, like seagulls cry
Electric dreams beneath the sky
Guitars wail, let the music play
This is our world, no time to stay

[chorus]
The rhythm's high, hearts are on fire
Eyes wide open, chasing the wire
Feel the rush, it's a summer spree
Oh, we're dancing free!

[bridge]
Keep it loud, keep it wild and free
We'll ride this wave just you and me
Drums will roar and flutes will sing
Together now, oh what a swing

[chorus]
The rhythm's high, hearts are on fire
Eyes wide open, chasing the wire
Feel the rush, it's a summer spree
Oh, we're dancing free!

[drum solo]
EY-EY-EY-EY (x4)

[outro]
Endless summers, we'll never fade
With every note, another serenade
