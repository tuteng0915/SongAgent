Lyrics :
[verse]
I'm screaming out loud,
In this mirror maze of life,
Looking for a way to break free,
From the shadows that confine.

[chorus]
We are the echoes of our own voice,
Shouting truths we must rejoice,
With every step, with every choice,
We carve our path, we make some noise.

[verse]
Through the static and the noise,
Finding clarity in the chaos,
Every heartbeat, every noise,
Is a testament to being alive.

[chorus]
We are the echoes of our own voice,
Shouting truths we must rejoice,
With every step, with every choice,
We carve our path, we make some noise.

[bridge]
Let's paint this town in colors so bright,
Our spirits unbroken, our future in sight,
No chains to hold us, no reason to fight,
Just the rhythm of life, setting everything right.
