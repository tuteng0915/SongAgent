Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

I’d like you to generate a French pop song that fits the following description:  

- It should be written in the style of a recent release (from 2016 onward).  
- The song features a male and female vocalist. They trade lines back and forth (one line sung by the man, the next by the woman), then harmonize or sing together on the subsequent verse and during the chorus.  
- The tempo is medium but leans toward the slower, more reflective side—nothing too energetic.  
- There’s a recurring lyrical theme where they use the word “if” (or its French equivalent, likely pronounced like “eef”) followed by rhyming words such as “exclusif” and “négatif.” For example:  
  - "If négatif ____ ____ ____ ____ ____"  
  - "If exclusif ____ ____ ____ ____ ____"  
  (Fill in the blanks with appropriate phrasing.)  
- The male singer has a deep, rich voice, while the female singer’s tone is light and gentle.  
- The title of the song should be a single word.  

Can you create this song for me? Include both the lyrics and any relevant tags that describe the mood, genre, and themes.
