Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echo of the night we find our way,
Underneath the moon, where shadows play.
Feel the rhythm in our hearts, it's never wrong,
Dancing to the beat, where we belong.

[chorus]
Oh, let's live it up, under starlit skies,
With every step, a new surprise.
Freedom's call, in the air tonight,
Together we'll shine, in the fading light.

[verse]
Words unspoken, in the music we confide,
Every note a story, side by side.
Laughter lines, on our faces they will show,
The joy of letting go, as we all know.

[bridge]
Turn it up, feel the rush, city lights in view,
Life's a dance, every soul, me and you.
In this moment, nothing else really matters,
Just the here and now, as time scatters.
