Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on the details I’m about to give you. The vibe should be pop or EDM, something fairly recent. Here's the concept: 

The song starts with this boy waking up in his room, getting ready for the day—putting on socks, preparing for ballet class. There are scenes of him practicing at the barre, then after class, he has a conversation with another guy that leaves him feeling disappointed. Later, he’s shown dancing alone on a playground while three other kids nearby seem frozen in place.

Could you create lyrics and tags for a song inspired by this story? Let’s aim for emotional yet uplifting tones, capturing both his struggles and moments of self-expression through dance.
