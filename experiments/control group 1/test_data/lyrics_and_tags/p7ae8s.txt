Lyrics :
[verse]
In the morning light I see your face
Smiling back at me with grace
Every little thing that you do
Fills my heart with love so true

[chorus]
Together we'll shine brighter than the sun
Our love's a melody that lifts us up
With you by my side, there's nothing we can't overcome
We'll dance to the rhythm of our hearts as one

[verse]
Hand in hand we walk along the shore
The waves crash around us, we're sure
That no storm can tear us apart
Because love is the shelter for our hearts

[chorus]
Together we'll shine brighter than the sun
Our love's a melody that lifts us up
With you by my side, there's nothing we can't overcome
We'll dance to the rhythm of our hearts as one

[bridge]
And when the night falls down
And the stars light up the sky
I'll be right here with you
Underneath the moonlit glow

[chorus]
Together we'll shine brighter than the sun
Our love's a melody that lifts us up
With you by my side, there's nothing we can't overcome
We'll dance to the rhythm of our hearts as one
