Lyrics :
[verse]
I can't believe it
In the quiet moments I find myself saying
Can you feel it
A gentle whisper in the night

[chorus]
Ohhhh but I â€”-
Search for meaning in the world to realize
That love is all we need
To heal and to grow

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight
We find our way, into the light
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
Together we'll soar, together we'll fly
