Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadow of the skyline, whispers float
A city with a death sentence, its final note

[chorus]
The clock is ticking, we all know the score
One year to live, what we're fighting for

[verse]
Kids no longer rush to school, lessons done
Playground songs are silent, under the sun

[chorus]
The clock is ticking, we all know the score
One year to live, dreams we can't restore

[bridge]
Empty streets where laughter used to be
Now just echoes of what's left of you and me
