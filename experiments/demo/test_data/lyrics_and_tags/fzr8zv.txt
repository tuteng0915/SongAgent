Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of yesterday, I find my way
Walking through memories, they never fade

[chorus]
Tears like rain, falling down again
Holding on to moments, that won't come back
In this lonely world, where love once was
I'm reaching out, for a fading star

[verse]
Every photograph, every smile so still
Carries a silence, that time can't fill

[chorus]
Tears like rain, falling down again
Holding on to moments, that won't come back
In this lonely world, where love once was
I'm reaching out, for a fading star

[bridge]
And if I could turn back time
I'd hold you closer, let the world stand still
But we're just shadows in the night
Chasing dreams that vanish with the light

[chorus]
Tears like rain, falling down again
Holding on to moments, that won't come back
In this lonely world, where love once was
I'm reaching out, for a fading star
