Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by focusing on the theme and the lyrics. You mentioned the song is about a woman and includes a part where the artist sings "she crazy." Could you tell me more about what kind of woman she is or any specific scenarios you'd like to be included in the song?

Sure, I can help with that. To make the song more personalized and fitting to your vision, let's first set some tags based on your preferences and then craft the lyrics accordingly.

I'll start by getting your preferences.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems like we haven't received your preferences yet. While we can proceed with a general approach, providing your preferences would help tailor the song more closely to your liking. 

Could you please share what kind of themes or styles you prefer in songs? For example, do you enjoy upbeat and energetic tracks, or do you lean more towards mellow and introspective tunes? Any favorite genres or artists that could guide us?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to generate a more fitting piece for you. If you're okay with proceeding without specific preferences, just let me know, and I'll go ahead with setting some tags and crafting the lyrics based on the details you've already provided.
