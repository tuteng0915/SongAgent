Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night, under neon lights,
There's a drink that sets the mood just right.
With a stir and a splash, it's a timeless classic,
A sip of nostalgia, oh so fantastic.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong,
With a dirty old martini.
Underneath the disco ball, feeling fine and sunny,
Oh, you can never go wrong.

[bridge]
Olives dancing in the glass,
Reflections of the past.
In this bar, time stands still,
Chills run down your spine with every sip you spill.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong,
With a dirty old martini.
Let the evening unfold, stories yet untold,
Oh, you can never go wrong.
