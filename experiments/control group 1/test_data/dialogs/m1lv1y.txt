Successfully set the parameter tags
I've set the tags for the song to include "80s, synth-pop, retro". Now let's create some lyrics that match this vibe. 

Here is a draft of the lyrics:

[verse]
Walking down the neon street,
Underneath the moonlit sky so sweet,
Got my Walkman playing tunes so tight,
Dancing through the night, feeling so right.

[chorus]
In this 80s world, we'll never fall apart,
Synthesizers in our hearts, living in a neon paradise,
Every moment feels like a fantasy ride,
In this 80s world, where dreams collide.

[verse]
Neon lights are flashing bright,
Lost in the rhythm of the night,
Big hair and denim jackets too,
Living life with a carefree attitude.

[chorus]
In this 80s world, we'll never fall apart,
Synthesizers in our hearts, living in a neon paradise,
Every moment feels like a fantasy ride,
In this 80s world, where dreams collide.

[bridge]
Oh, the arcade games and the VHS tapes,
Memories captured in time, like vintage postcards,
Let's take a trip back to when life was simple,
And every day felt like a brand new adventure.

[chorus]
In this 80s world, we'll never fall apart,
Synthesizers in our hearts, living in a neon paradise,
Every moment feels like a fantasy ride,
In this 80s world, where dreams collide.
