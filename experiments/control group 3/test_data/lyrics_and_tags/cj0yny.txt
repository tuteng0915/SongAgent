Lyrics :
[verse]
Ripples in the moonlit sea
Echoes of a melody free
Waves they crash upon the shore
Memories forevermore

[chorus]
Oh, take me back to where it began
To the sound of the waves and the touch of your hand
In the depths of my heart, I hold you near
Through the waters of time, you reappear

[bridge]
Tides may turn, but I'll never forget
The way the ocean kissed the sunset
A timeless dance, a symphony grand
With every wave, I understand

[chorus]
Oh, take me back to where it began
To the sound of the waves and the touch of your hand
In the depths of my heart, I hold you near
Through the waters of time, you reappear
