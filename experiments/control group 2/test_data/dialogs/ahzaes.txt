Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on these details. It’s an upbeat, fast-paced pop song by a female singer, and it would have been released around 2002. The vibe of the song is kind of cold or autumnal, with a music video that features a collage of photos. The chorus has lyrics along the lines of "and life is too shorrrt to something something forrr youuuu." 

Can you create a song that fits this description?

  [verse]
  Walking down these streets
  Feeling the cold breeze
  I know it's time to leave
  But something keeps me here
  
  [chorus]
  And life is too shorrrt to be afraid forrr youuuu
  We'll dance in the rain, let the world fade to blue
  
  [verse]
  Memories flash by
  Like pages of a book
  Each one a little sigh
  As I try to take a look
  
  [chorus]
  And life is too shorrrt to be afraid forrr youuuu
  We'll dance in the rain, let the world fade to blue
  
  [bridge]
  In this moment, we're alive
  Let the pictures tell our story
  Through the autumn, through the sky
  We'll find our place in glory
