Lyrics :
[verse]
In the silence, echoes of your name
A ghost of memories, I can't reclaim

[chorus]
Lost in the shadows of what we had
Fading like whispers, a love gone bad
But I'll find peace, though you're miles away
In the remnants of yesterday

[verse]
Walking these streets, where we used to roam
Feeling so lost, trying to find home

[chorus]
Lost in the shadows of what we had
Fading like whispers, a love gone bad
But I'll find peace, though you're miles away
In the remnants of yesterday

[bridge]
The pain will linger, but time will heal
In the quiet moments, I'll feel
The strength to let go, and start anew
Though every step feels heavy with you
