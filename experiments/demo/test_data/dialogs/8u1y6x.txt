I'd like a song with a male singer, an upbeat tempo, and a lyric about listening or waving through a window. Can you do that?

Sure, I can create a song based on your inputs. To specify, you want:

- A male singer
- An upbeat tempo
- Lyrics about listening or waving through a window

Am I correct? And is there any other preferences that you would like me to consider? Such as the language of the lyrics, or specific musical instruments you want to be included?
User : 
Yeah, that's right! And maybe include some piano in the background? The language should be English.

Alright, I've set the parameters for your song. It's with a male singer, upbeat tempo and includes piano as you requested. The lyrics are in English and revolve around themes of listening and waving through a window.

Here's a snippet of the lyrics:
```
[Verse]
I'm listening through the window pane,
Hear the world as it calls my name.
In this room, I'm safe inside,
But my heart is waving to the tide.

[Chorus]
Wave through the glass, let the sounds seep in,
A symphony of life, a world beneath my skin.
With every note and every sigh,
I'm listening, waving goodbye.

[Bridge]
The piano whispers secrets untold,
Its keys unlocking dreams of old.
Through this pane, I see the sun,
And know my solitary dance has just begun.
