I'm ready to help you create the perfect romantic wedding song! To start, could you describe the general theme or mood you're aiming for in this song? For instance, do you want it to feel dreamy, passionate, nostalgic, or something else?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that! To ensure the song perfectly captures the essence of your romantic wedding, could you also provide some additional details? For example:

- Any specific instruments or sounds you'd like to include (e.g., piano, strings, acoustic guitar)?
- Are there particular lyrics or phrases you want to be incorporated?
- Do you have a preferred tempo or rhythm in mind?

This information will help me tailor the song more precisely to your vision.
User : 
Let's go with a dreamy and passionate vibe. That should set the right tone for a romantic wedding. How about we include some smooth guitar riffs, maybe something like "Something" by The Beatles? And perhaps a male singer with a soothing rock voice?

Great! I've set the tags for your song to include a dreamy and passionate vibe, smooth guitar riffs reminiscent of "Something" by The Beatles, and a male singer with a soothing rock voice.

Next, let's work on the lyrics. Do you have any specific lyrics or phrases you'd like included in the song? If not, I can generate some fitting lyrics based on the theme we've discussed.
User : 
That sounds wonderful! For the lyrics, I'm thinking something heartfelt and emotional, but I don't have any specific lines in mind. Can you come up with some touching phrases that capture the essence of a romantic wedding?

I've crafted some heartfelt lyrics that aim to capture the essence of a romantic wedding. Here's what I came up with:

```
[verse]
In the soft glow of twilight's embrace,
Where whispers of love find their place.
Hand in hand, we walk this aisle,
With dreams that forever compile.

[chorus]
Oh, my love, in your eyes I see forever,
A promise made, now and always together.
With every breath, with all that I am,
I'll be yours, under the stars and moon's demand.

[verse]
Velvet skies drape our sacred night,
As hearts entwine in pure delight.
Each moment cherished, memories to keep,
In this journey of love, so deep, so steep.

[bridge]
Through every season, come what may,
Our song will echo, never stray.
With gentle strums of fateâ€™s sweet strings,
Together we'll soar on love's wings.

[chorus]
Oh, my love, in your eyes I see forever,
A promise made, now and always together.
With every breath, with all that I am,
I'll be yours, under the stars and moon's demand.
```
