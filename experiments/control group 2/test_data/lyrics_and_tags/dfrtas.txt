Lyrics :
[intro]
[chanting] This is Halloween, this is Halloween...

[verse 1]
A is for Alice, who fell down a hole,
B is for Brian, attacked by a mole,
C is for Clara, who choked on her gum,
D is for Danny, who met with a drum.

[chorus]
From A to Z, they all met their end,
In ways you'd least expect, not hard to comprehend,
Tonight's the night, we celebrate the dead,
With every letter, another life we shed!

[verse 2]
E is for Eddie, who vanished in mist,
F is for Fiona, by poison dismissed,
G is for Gregor, devoured by his fears,
H is for Helen, who lost both her ears.

[chorus]
From A to Z, they all met their end,
In ways you'd least expect, not hard to comprehend,
Tonight's the night, we celebrate the dead,
With every letter, another life we shed!

[bridge]
Ooooh, it's creepy, it's kooky,
Mysterious and spooky,
With laughter and frights,
It's alphabet nights!

[verse 3]
I is for Iris, impaled by a rake,
J is for Janice, who died in a lake,
K is for Kyle, crushed under stone,
L is for Lucy, forever alone.

[chorus]
From A to Z, they all met their end,
In ways you'd least expect, not hard to comprehend,
Tonight's the night, we celebrate the dead,
With every letter, another life we shed!

[outro]
Z is for Zachary, zapped by a wire,
Now our morbid tale has reached its final mire,
So light up your pumpkins, hang skeletons high,
For tonight, we dance beneath the haunted sky!
