Hello, song agent! I need a deeply emotional and melancholic tune with a female singer. Can you start working on that?

I see, to better suit your needs, could you please specify what kind of emotion you want the song to convey? And do you have any specific themes or lyrics in mind for this melancholic tune with a female singer?
User : 
Sure, the song should evoke a sense of hopelessness and mention something about pills. Can we also have a part where letters are spelled out, maybe "C", "B", and "A"?

I've crafted a melancholic song with a female singer that conveys a deep sense of hopelessness, mentioning pills and spelling out the letters "C", "B", and "A" in the bridge. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Lost in the echoes of my mind
I find no solace, no peace to find

[chorus]
Pills on the table, silent screams
The world keeps turning, or so it seems

[verse]
In this darkness, I'm losing track
Of who I am and what I lack

[bridge]
C-B-A, counting down
Each letter a memory, a lost crown

[chorus]
Pills on the table, silent cries
The world moves on as hope goodbye
