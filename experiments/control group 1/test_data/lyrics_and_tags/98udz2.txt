Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I think of you
Every heartbeat sings your name, it's true

[chorus]
Love like a fire, burning so bright
Guiding me through the darkest night
With you, my heart finds its home
Together we'll never be alone

[bridge]
Hand in hand, we walk this path
Every moment feels so vast
