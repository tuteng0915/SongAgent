Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the shadows, I see a light,
Clear skies ahead, shining so bright.
Every step I take, brings me closer to my dreams,
In this journey of life, nothing’s as it seems.

[chorus]
We’re chasing dreams, reaching for the sky,
With every heartbeat, we learn to fly.
Bright futures ahead, let the past subside,
Together we rise, with hope as our guide.

[verse]
Voices in the wind, whispering to be strong,
Through the toughest days, where we truly belong.
The road is long, but we’ll find our way,
With each new dawn, comes a brighter day.

[chorus]
We’re chasing dreams, reaching for the sky,
With every heartbeat, we learn to fly.
Bright futures ahead, let the past subside,
Together we rise, with hope as our guide.

[bridge]
Clear skies ahead, no storm can hold us down,
Our spirits unbroken, in this dance we astound.
Lift your eyes, see the world anew,
This is our moment, me and you.
