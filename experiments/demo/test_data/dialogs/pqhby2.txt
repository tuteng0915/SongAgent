I'd like to create an epic metal song with orchestral elements and intense parts. Can we start working on that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I understand your preferences correctly, could you please specify any particular themes or emotions you want the song to convey? Also, do you have a preference for the tempo or any specific instruments you'd like to feature?

Let's also check your general preferences to ensure we align with your tastes.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences on file, could you provide some additional details? For instance, do you prefer a faster or slower tempo in your epic metal songs? Are there any specific instruments or vocal styles you enjoy?

Once I have a clearer picture, I'll generate the tags and lyrics for your epic metal song with orchestral elements.
User : 
The song should paint a picture of a snowy forest, solitude, and contrast. It needs to start emotional and build up to an explosive climax. And yes, faster tempo with powerful drums and soaring strings would be great.

Great! I've set the tags for your epic metal song to include orchestral elements, a fast tempo, powerful drums, soaring strings, and themes of a snowy forest, solitude, contrast, emotional depth, and an explosive climax.

Now, let's work on the lyrics. I'll create a structure with verses, choruses, and a bridge to build up the story and emotion.

I've crafted the lyrics for your epic metal song. Here's a preview:

[verse]
In the heart of winter's embrace,
A lone wolf howls, lost in space.
Snowflakes fall, silent and cold,
Solitude's tale, never told.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.

[verse]
Contrasts collide in frosty air,
Shadows dance without a care.
Whispers of warmth in icy veins,
A fleeting moment, love remains.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.

[bridge]
The calm before the storm arrives,
Silent whispers break the ties.
Explosions echo through the night,
As dawn breaks, we stand united.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.

User : 
The lyrics are good, but I also want clean vocals at the start and powerful metal screaming towards the climax. Can we add that?
