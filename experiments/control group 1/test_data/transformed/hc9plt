Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I need you to generate a mellow, smooth acoustic guitar-driven song with English lyrics that could be sung by a Hispanic artist. The song should include the phrases "I can't believe it," "can you feel it," "ohhhh but I —-" and "in the world to realize." Keep the tone emotional and reflective, capturing a sense of introspection and wonder. Let’s create something that feels like it could fit into Marc Anthony's style if he were singing in English.
