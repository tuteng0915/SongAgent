Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I'd like you to generate a song based on the following details: It should be in the pop genre with a moderately paced, groovy, and chill vibeâ€”something that feels catchy and fits well within a "Trap" influenced station. The singer should be female, and the chorus needs to include the lyrics "ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow" (feel free to adjust the number of 'owees' to make it flow better). Keep the overall tone engaging but laid-back, capturing that memorable and addictive quality. Let's create something that could easily be mistaken for a hit song I might hear during a workout!
