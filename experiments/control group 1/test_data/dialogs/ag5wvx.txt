I need a song that starts with funky rock elements, featuring groovy guitar riffs and a playful rhythm. Can you add an exaggerated laugh in the intro?

I've set up your song with funky rock elements, groovy guitar riffs, and a playful rhythm. An exaggerated laugh has been added to the intro as you requested. Here's a snippet of the lyrics:

[intro]
*exaggerated laugh*

[verse 1]
Bouncing to the beat, feeling so fine,
Grooving through the night, under neon signs.
Shadows dance and they twist and turn,
In this funky world, there's much to learn.
