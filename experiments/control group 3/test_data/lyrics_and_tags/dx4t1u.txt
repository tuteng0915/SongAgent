Lyrics :
[verse]
Caught in the haze of yesterday's high
Chasing shadows, losing the light

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all

[verse]
Falling deeper into the void
Searching for a way to rewind

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all

[bridge]
The chains that bind me, they're invisible
A war inside, my personal hell

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all
