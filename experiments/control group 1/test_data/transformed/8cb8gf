Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that matches some specific details. Here's what I have in mind:

- It should be an upbeat pop song, created around 3-4 years ago.
- The artist is likely an African American male.
- The theme of the song revolves around bad things happening but maintaining happiness regardless.
- There might be references to going to work or walking down the street.
- The song should also inspire a dance where someone puts their hands up like "I don't know" during one verse and points at their feet during another part of the chorus.

Can you help me generate a song that fits these criteria?
