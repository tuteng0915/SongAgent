Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate a song that starts with a scene of an old man lying in a hospital bed. Suddenly, a woman bursts in, singing "Do you remember" accompanied by a marching band. The song should then transition into flashbacks, perhaps showing scenes of dancing on a hillside, while still featuring the old man in his hospital bed or wheelchair. The overall sound and style should be very similar to Florence and the Machine. 

Please generate this song for me.

I have generated the song based on your request. The tags reflect the emotional storytelling style akin to Florence and the Machine, with elements of a marching band, flashbacks, dancing, and poignant scenes involving an old man in a hospital setting.

Here are the lyrics I've crafted for you:

[verse]
In the quiet room, an old man lies,
Memories flicker in his weary eyes.
A sudden burst, the door flies wide,
A woman enters with a song to bide.

[chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The hills we danced on, the love that was all.
With every note, the past unfolds,
A tale of joy, a tale untold.

[verse]
Flashbacks swirl, like leaves in flight,
Dancing on the hill under moonlit light.
Yet here he sits, in his chair so still,
As she sings her song, defying time's will.

[bridge]
Marching band joins in the refrain,
Echoes of laughter, echoes of pain.
Life's final chapter, yet music remains,
Binding us close through life's changing lanes.

[chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The hills we danced on, the love that was all.
With every beat, our hearts align,
In this timeless melody divine.
