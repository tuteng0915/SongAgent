Lyrics :
[verse]
Rollin' down the street in that low-low jeep,
Bass knockin' hard, got the whole block on repeat.
Smell the chronic, it's the scent of success,
West Coast vibes, yeah, we do it the best.

[chorus]
It's the boogie woogie yeahhh (yeahhh)
Feel the rhythm and the flow don't stop (don't stop)
It's the essence of them aaaallll (aaaallll)
When the beat drops, everybody on call.

[verse 2]
Synth lines sliding like a snake in the grass,
High hats snapping, time to crank up the bass.
Forgot about the stress, just ride with me,
This is more than music, it's a legacy.

[bridge]
From Compton streets to the world we rise,
Under neon lights and Cali skies.
This ain't just a song, it's a vibe, an era,
Feel the funk and let it carry you nearer.

[chorus]
It's the boogie woogie yeahhh (yeahhh)
Feel the rhythm and the flow don't stop (don't stop)
It's the essence of them aaaallll (aaaallll)
When the beat drops, everybody on call.
