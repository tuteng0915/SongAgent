Lyrics :
[verse]
There she goes, moving to the beat
In a world where love and music meet
With every step, she casts a spell
A dance floor queen, can you dig it baby

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down
Can you dig it baby

[verse]
He's got a voice like Marvin Sease
Singing songs of love, making hearts team
With every note, he lights up the room
And those backup voices, they bring the boom

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down
Can you dig it baby

[bridge]
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme
Let's keep dancing till the end of time
In this moment, we're alive
Together we'll thrive, let's take a dive

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down
Can you dig it baby
