Since I don't have your preferences yet, let's go ahead and set a general direction for the song. Could you provide me with some themes or imagery you'd like to see in the lyrics? For example, we could explore topics like nature, love, heartbreak, or even something more abstract like colors or dreams. This will help me craft something truly special for you. If you're not sure, I can suggest something based on common themes. What do you think?
