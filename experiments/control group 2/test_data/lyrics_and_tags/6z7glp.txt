Lyrics :
[verse]
At the gas station mart, a girl in a wheelchair
A fallen toy at her feet, so unaware
I picked it up with a smile, asked if she was alright
Her eyes, they gleamed, under the cold moonlight

[chorus]
Trapped in their web, I'm losing myself
In this false life on a cursed shelf
Pretend to be wife, pretend to be mom
But my soul is screaming, where do I belong?

[verse]
They took me home, their faces so kind
But behind closed doors, chains that bind
The walls whisper secrets, shadows play their part
I'm sinking deeper into this broken heart

[bridge]
Digging my grave, hands bleeding and raw
Forced to sing as I face my last straw
The melody haunts, like ghosts in the air
Each note a tear, each breath a prayer

[chorus]
Buried alive, yet my voice won't die
Singing for help beneath the cold sky
A nightmare made real, no escape from this place
Eternal silence wraps its embrace

[outro]
Still singing softly, though there's no one near
My song ascends, carried by fear
Through dirt and darkness, it will always remain
A haunting echo of my endless pain
