Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been standing here for too long
Hiding my feelings, playing along
You smile and it cuts like a knife
We're dancing on the edge of what might've been

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[verse]
Every laugh we share is bittersweet
Every casual touch sends chills down my spine
But you're oblivious to the signs I show
I guess some things are better left unsaid

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[bridge]
If only I could turn back time
Erase these feelings, make you mine
But I know that dreams don't come true
When you're living half a life with you

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[outro]
So here's to us, and all we'll never be
Forever friends, but never meant to be
