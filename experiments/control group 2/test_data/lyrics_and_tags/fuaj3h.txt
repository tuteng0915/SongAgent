Lyrics :
[verse]
I'm frozen in this endless night
Can't move, can't breathe, just hold on tight
My heart is numb, it doesn't beat
A prisoner of my own defeat

[chorus]
The world around me fades away
Shadows dance and steal the day
I scream but there's no sound I make
Lost within this eerie lake

[verse]
Each step feels heavier than before
The ground beneath won't hold me anymore
Numbness spreads from head to toe
In this abyss, I'll never grow

[bridge]
Is there a way out of this shell?
Or am I destined for this hell?
Together we could break these chains
Feel alive amidst our pains

[chorus]
The world around us fades away
Shadows dance and steal the day
We scream but there's no sound we make
Together trapped in this eerie lake
