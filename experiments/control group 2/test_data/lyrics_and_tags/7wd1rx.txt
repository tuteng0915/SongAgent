Lyrics :
[verse]
In the night, a shadow moves
A stranger in the dark, his secrets never told

[chorus]
Stranger, oh stranger, where have you been?
A face in the crowd, lost in the neon glow

[verse]
Underneath the city lights
The echoes call your name, but you're already gone

[chorus]
Stranger, oh stranger, where will you go?
The world is spinning fast, and you're a mystery

[bridge]
Every corner holds a story untold
But you, you're just passing through

[chorus]
Stranger, oh stranger, in the city of dreams
Where every heartbeat syncs with the rhythm of the night
