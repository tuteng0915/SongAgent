Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been waiting for this moment, a spark in the dark to ignite,
Every step that I've taken, has led me straight into the light.

[chorus]
I'd give anything just to hear you say to me,
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard,
Go on, go on, let the words spill out like a song,
I'm done holding back, this is where I truly belong.

[verse]
The world keeps spinning faster, but I'm standing still,
Caught between the thrill of the fall and the force of my will.

[chorus]
I'd give anything just to hear you say to me,
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard,
Go on, go on, let the words spill out like a song,
I'm done holding back, this is where I truly belong.

[bridge]
It's a fight, it's a flame, it's everything I am,
In this moment, I won't back down, no, I won't bend.

[chorus]
I'd give anything just to hear you say to me,
That I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard,
Go on, go on, let the words spill out like a song,
I'm done holding back, this is where I truly belong.
