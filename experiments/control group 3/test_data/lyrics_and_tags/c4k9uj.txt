Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
We were young and free under neon lights,
Dancing all night, everything felt right.
Remember those days, they slipped away,
But tonight, we'll bring them back to play.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
Yeah yeah, make these memories last forever bright.

[Verse 2]
Glitter on the floor, stars in our eyes,
Every moment felt like paradise.
Lost in the rhythm, lost in the sound,
In this world of ours, nothing can bring us down.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
Yeah yeah, make these memories last forever bright.

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh, feel the rush,
Like a dream that we never had enough.
Hands in the air, we don't care,
This is our night, we'll take it anywhere.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
Yeah yeah, make these memories last forever bright.
