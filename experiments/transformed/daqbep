Hey there! I'd like you to generate a song that matches the following description: It's a hip-hop/R&B track with a slightly upbeat rhythm, performed by a male artist with a Jamaican or Haitian accent. The vibe should be romantic but not overly intenseâ€”think less Boyz II Men and more laid-back beach vibes. Picture a scene where the beach meets the tree line close to the shoreline. Oh, and it has that one-hit wonder feel to it. Can you create something like this?
