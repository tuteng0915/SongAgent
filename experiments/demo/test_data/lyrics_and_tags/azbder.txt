Lyrics :
[verse]
In the garden of Eden, where stories unfold
Mix tapes and Walkmans, secrets untold
Dancing in rooms bathed in moonlight streams
Living those dreams, dreams of timeless themes

[chorus]
Oh, we'll go back to Eden's prime
To the rhythm and the chime
When the music played loud
And our spirits were never down
In the era of fun, under the neon sun
We danced through the night till the morning comes

[verse]
Skateboards rolling on paths of gold
Denim jackets, simple threads, weaving us bold
Video games and the TV glow
Back when things were easy, in Eden we'd grow

[chorus]
Oh, we'll go back to Eden's prime
To the rhythm and the chime
When the music played loud
And our spirits were never down
In the era of fun, under the neon sun
We danced through the night till the morning comes

[bridge]
Time may pass, but Eden stays
In our hearts, its beauty plays
The echoes of laughter, the tunes so sweet
A timeless journey, where souls compete

[chorus]
Oh, we'll go back to Eden's prime
To the rhythm and the chime
When the music played loud
And our spirits were never down
In the era of fun, under the neon sun
We danced through the night till the morning comes

[ending]
So let's keep Eden's moments alive today
In every heartbeat, in every way
