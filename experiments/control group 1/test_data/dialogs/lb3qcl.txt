User : 
I understand you're looking for a song with a melancholic violin line and a 90s adult pop vibe. To start, could you tell me more about the theme or message you'd like the lyrics to convey?
Agent : 
Sure, let's first set the basic parameters for the song based on your preferences.



the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since we don't have specific preferences on file for you yet, I'll go ahead and set some initial tags based on our conversation. We'll aim for a melancholic feel with a 90s adult pop vibe, featuring a prominent violin line.

Let's also draft some placeholder lyrics that can be refined once we know more about the message you'd like to convey.

I've set the initial tags and lyrics for our song. The tags include "melancholic", "90s", "adult pop", and "violin" to match your request. Here are the draft lyrics:

```
[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Where shadows dance and dreams compete

[chorus]
In the silence, hear my plea
A heart lost in melody

[bridge]
Strings of sorrow, tales untold
The night embraces, dark and cold
```

Please feel free to provide more details about the theme or message you'd like the lyrics to convey so we can refine them further.
