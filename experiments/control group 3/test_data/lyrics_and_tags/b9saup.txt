Lyrics :
[verse] Something weird and wonderful, bouncing in my brain, tickling my thoughts, driving me insane! In my pickup truck, under the neon fire, life's a wild ride spinning like a tire!
[chorus] It's the craziest thing, got me laughing and singing, all through the day. Oh what a sight, feeling so bright, raising a beer to the night and the light!
[bridge] Who knew ridiculous could feel so right, jumping into chaos with delight! With flames on the side and stars in our eyes, we're revving up dreams in this wild countryside!
