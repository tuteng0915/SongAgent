Lyrics :
[verse]
Driving through the dawn, my girl asleep
The city wakes as shadows creep
Another day, another fight
In this endless loop, I lose myself

[chorus]
Stuck in a rhythm of gray despair
Dreams slipping through like morning air
Unseen, unloved, just fading away
In this cycle of mundane ballet

[verse]
Office walls confine my soul
Numbers dance, a scripted role
Promises made, now left behind
A silent scream within my mind

[chorus]
Stuck in a rhythm of gray despair
Dreams slipping through like morning air
Unseen, unloved, just fading away
In this cycle of mundane ballet

[bridge]
At dinner, neighbors' laughter fills the air
Their joy a stark contrast to my despair
I wear a smile, but inside it's clear
That thoughts of escape grow ever near

[verse]
The weight upon my shoulders grows
As night descends, my resolve shows
Contemplating paths I've never tread
Where silence reigns and dreams are dead

[chorus]
Breaking free from the chains of gray
Reaching out for the light of day
Seen, beloved, no longer confined
To this dance of the everyday grind

[outro]
But then I look at my daughterâ€™s face
And find a reason to embrace
The fleeting moments life may bring
Holding on to hope amidst everything

[final verse]
Yet as the days blur into nights
I ponder ends and lost fights
If freedom calls from beyond the veil
Would courage fail or would I sail
