Hey there! I'd like you to generate a slow, mellow breakup song for me. The theme should revolve around the girlfriend leaving one day, capturing all those raw emotions of heartbreak and longing. Oh, and towards the end, can we include a poignant twist with a line like: "I thought I saw you the other day, dad!" Let's make it resonate deeply with listeners who've experienced loss and reflection. Looking forward to what you come up with!
