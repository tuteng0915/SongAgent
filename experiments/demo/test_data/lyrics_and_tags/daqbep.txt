Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking along the shoreline, feeling the ocean breeze
Sunset painting the sky, colors dancing with ease
Your laughter cuts through the waves, a melody so sweet
This moment feels like magic, our hearts skip a beat

[chorus]
Oh, this summer fling, it's got us flying high
Underneath the starlit sky, where dreams never die
We'll chase the night, let the moonlight guide our way
In this fleeting romance, every moment feels like May

[verse]
Barefoot on the boardwalk, stars reflecting in your eyes
The world fades away as we share this sweet surprise
Hand in hand, we wander, lost in each other's glow
Every step is a promise, a story only we know

[chorus]
Oh, this summer fling, it's got us flying high
Underneath the starlit sky, where dreams never die
We'll chase the night, let the moonlight guide our way
In this fleeting romance, every moment feels like May

[bridge]
Though the tides will change and seasons will turn
These memories will linger, a gentle burn
A whisper of summer, a touch of gold
In the chapters of my heart, this tale will unfold

[chorus]
Oh, this summer fling, it's got us flying high
Underneath the starlit sky, where dreams never die
We'll chase the night, let the moonlight guide our way
In this fleeting romance, every moment feels like May
