Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows where silence grows
A heart of steel begins to close
Every echo of a memory fades
Clinging to the chains that bind us here

[chorus]
Lost in the rhythm of your name
BOOM CLINK echoes through the pain
Longing for a touch so frail
In this endless industrial trail

[verse]
The clinking chains, they never rest
Each beat a scar upon my chest
I sing to you from worlds apart
Hoping my voice finds your heart

[bridge]
And if the world should fall away
Our song will rise from the decay
We'll find each other in the dark
Guided by love's eternal spark

[chorus]
Lost in the rhythm of your name
BOOM CLINK echoes through the pain
Longing for a touch so frail
In this endless industrial trail
