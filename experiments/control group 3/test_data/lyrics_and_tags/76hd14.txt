Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the misty morn, shadows dance in silent warn,
Every step a tale untold, whispers of a world so bold.

[chorus]
Hooray, hooray, let the past behind,
Forward we go, with hearts aglow.
Mysteries unfold as we embark,
On this journey, leaving marks.

[verse]
Eyes wide open to the new, colors burst in vibrant hue,
In every corner, secrets hide, urging us to come inside.

[chorus]
Hooray, hooray, let the past behind,
Forward we go, with hearts aglow.
Mysteries unfold as we embark,
On this journey, leaving marks.

[ending]
but now I don't,
but now I don't,
but now I don't.
