Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I want to generate a song based on a very specific and eerie concept. The song should revolve around a chilling narrative involving a woman who encounters a mysterious little girl in a wheelchair at a gas station mart. The girl drops a toy, and when the woman tries to return it, she finds herself in a nightmare scenario where she’s forced into a false family role—pretending to be the wife and mother of the people who trapped her. Eventually, she ends up digging her own grave before being buried alive while still singing.

The tone should be haunting, melancholic, and somewhat surreal, with lyrics that capture both her initial confusion and eventual despair. The style can have a dark cinematic feel, reminiscent of gothic or alternative music from before 2015. 

Please include these key elements:
- A description of the gas station encounter.
- The moment when she realizes she's trapped in this false life.
- Her emotions as she digs her own grave and sings through the horror.

Can you create something that fits this mood and storyline?
