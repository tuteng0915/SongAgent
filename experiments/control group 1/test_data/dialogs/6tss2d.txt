User : 
I want to create a pop punk song, something like Less Than Jake or Goldfinger. It starts with someone making a phone ringing sound and saying "I know she's home." Can you work with that?

Sure, I can work with that. Let's create a pop punk song in the style of Less Than Jake or Goldfinger. 

I'll set the tags and lyrics accordingly. Here's what I've come up with:

Tags: pop punk, Less Than Jake, Goldfinger, energetic, upbeat

Lyrics:
[verse]
(Sound effect: phone ringing)
"I know she's home."

Let me set these parameters for you.
