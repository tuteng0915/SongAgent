Hello, Song Agent! I need your help to generate a song that fits the following description: It should be a classic rock song with a calm and melancholic tone, sung by a woman, ideally from the 80's or 90's. The song should start with lyrics similar to "I know, you..." or "anno, you..." and include a line that ends with "... and surrender." This is a very popular song that you might have heard on the radio before. Can you create something that matches this description? Thank you!

[verse]
I know, you've been through this before
But somehow, it feels different now

[chorus]
And I'll stand by you, as we walk through the storm
Together we'll find a place where we belong
Embrace the night, and surrender

[bridge]
The echoes of our past will fade away
In the arms of tomorrow, we'll find our way
```
