Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night,
I find your face in every star,
Every whisper of the wind,
Carries your name from afar.

[chorus]
Love like ours will never fade,
It's written in the skies,
With every heartbeat, every breath,
Together we'll never die.

[verse]
Morning comes too soon,
Yet I hold you in my dreams,
Your laughter fills my soul,
Like rivers to the seas.

[chorus]
Love like ours will never fade,
It's written in the skies,
With every heartbeat, every breath,
Together we'll never die.

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight,
Our bond grows stronger still,
In this world of fleeting moments,
Our love stands eternal till.
