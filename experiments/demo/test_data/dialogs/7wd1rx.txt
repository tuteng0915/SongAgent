Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by focusing on the theme of the song. Since you mentioned the repetition of the word "stranger," could you tell me if this song is about a mysterious person or more about feeling out of place?
Agent : 
Great! Understanding the theme will help shape the lyrics and tone of the song. If you could also share any specific emotions or scenarios you'd like to convey, that would be very helpful. For example, is the song meant to feel eerie and suspenseful, or more introspective and melancholic?
User : 
Let's aim for a tone that's introspective and melancholic, with a hint of mystery.

Now, let's work on the lyrics. Hereâ€™s a draft for the first verse and chorus:

[verse]
In the quiet of the night, shadows dance with grace,
A stranger walks alone, through the foggy streets.
Whispers in the air, carry tales untold,
Eyes that pierce the dark, secrets they hold.

[chorus]
Stranger, who are you?
Lost in this endless hue,
Walking through the echoes, fading from view,
Stranger, where do you go?
When the world doesn't know,
If you ever find home, will you let me follow?
