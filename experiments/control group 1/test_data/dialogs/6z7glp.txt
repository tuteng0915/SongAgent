User : 
I want a song that tells a dark and eerie story. It should have a haunting and melancholic tone, with a surreal narrative about a woman who meets a mysterious girl at a gas station. Can you start with that?

[verse]
On a desolate road, under moon's cold gaze,
A woman stops for fuel, lost in a haze.
At the gas station, she meets a girl so still,
With eyes like deep wells, and a voice that chills.

[chorus]
In the silence, whispers weave through the air,
Tales of shadows, secrets that none could dare.
The girl speaks in riddles, her words intertwine,
Leading the woman to a fate undefined.

[verse]
They walk through an abyss, where reality fades,
To find what awaits in these haunted glades.
The stars above blink out, one by one,
As they journey together till the night is done.
