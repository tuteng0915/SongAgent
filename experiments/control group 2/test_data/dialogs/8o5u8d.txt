Hello, Song Generating Agent! I need your help to create a song based on the following requirements:

The song should be in the style of a pre-11/2012 upbeat pop track by an African American or Black female artist. The theme revolves around the end of the world, with a quirky and humorous twist. It should include a robot voice at the end saying, "Oh, you had triplets instead of twins? Your pork tastes like chicken?" Additionally, there should be a verse about zombies in the backyard going crazy.

Could you please generate such a song for me? Thank you!
