Lyrics :
[verse]
Daddy's here, little one, don't you cry
I know you miss her, I do too, every night
[chorus]
But we'll be okay, you and me
We'll make it through, just wait and see
[bridge]
She's watching over us from above
Her love will guide us, my dear son
[chorus]
But we'll be okay, you and me
We'll make it through, just wait and see
[ending]
Together we stand, hand in hand
With her love, we'll make our final stand
