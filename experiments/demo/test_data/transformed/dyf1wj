Request to the Song Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a fun, poppy song with folky undertones inspired by the style of music that was popular around 2008. The song should tell a story about a wolf or someone who is born with fur, and it should be sung from the perspective of a young male singer. The lyrics should include some key phrases like “now my friends do not know,” “my body’s covered in fur,” or “you can wear my fur.” It’s important that the tone stays lighthearted and fun despite the quirky subject matter. The song could follow the narrative arc of growing up as a wolf-like person, meeting someone special, and navigating life with this unique trait. Please also tag the song appropriately so I can get a sense of its vibe and themes. Thank you!
