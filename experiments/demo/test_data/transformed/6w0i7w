Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a certain vibe I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want the song to capture that 2000's Vans Warped Tour energy—super high-energy, fast-paced with rapid drumming, and an overall pop-punk or emo feel. The lyrics should revolve around holding on to a past love, filled with nostalgia and maybe some longing. Oh, and at some point in the song, it would be cool if we could include the phrase “back back back” to give it that repetitive, anthemic quality.

Can you whip up something like this for me?
