Lyrics :
[intro]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...

[verse 1]
Female Singer: Walking down these aisles again,
Nothing's ever as it seems,
But the beat keeps callin' me,
To dance among the frozen dreams.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: It's the rhythm of the store,
It's the pulse of every door,
Every shelf and every floor,
Yeah, we can't ignore no more.

[verse 2]
Female Singer: Cereal boxes line the walls,
The dairy section calls and calls,
While I groove to this unseen beat,
My shopping cart becomes my feet.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: It's the rhythm of the store,
It's the pulse of every door,
Every shelf and every floor,
Yeah, we can't ignore no more.

[bridge]
Female Singer: From the veggies to the snacks,
This beat is where the fun's at,
In this supermarket scene,
We're dancing through the in-between.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: It's the rhythm of the store,
It's the pulse of every door,
Every shelf and every floor,
Yeah, we can't ignore no more.

[outro]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
