Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a very specific vibe. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should have piano playing chords as part of its instrumentation, and the overall tone should be relatively upbeat. The style should feel like it’s from the late 70s or early 80s—think retro but timeless. It doesn’t need to sound *too* polished; maybe even something that could’ve been a modest hit or a one-hit wonder for a band back then.  

The subject matter is where it gets fun—it should be atypical, not your typical love song or party anthem. Maybe something about science, math, or technology? And if you can weave in an undertone of fear or unease, that would be perfect. Oh, and I imagine the title might follow a simple structure like “The _______ Song” (fill-in-the-blank style).  

Can you help me create something along those lines? Let’s see some lyrics and tags!

### Lyrics:
```
[verse]
In the lab where shadows grow
Equations dance, we're in the flow
Microchips whisper, secrets untold
Binary beats echo, brave and bold

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back?

[verse]
Logarithms leap, they twist and turn
Through cosmic loops for which we yearn
A paradox lies in every byte
Where truth is blurred by endless night

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back?

[bridge]
Beneath the glow of the CRT
We code our fate, yet none are free
The future calls with static sound
As man and machine spin round and round

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back? 

[outro]
So here we stand on silicon sands
With borrowed time in mechanical hands
Sing the song before it's gone
This Algorithm Song.
```
