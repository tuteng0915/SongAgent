User : 
I need a song with a slow, melancholic tone, like opera music, and it should feel cinematic and emotional. Can you start with that?

I have set the tone and lyrics for a slow, melancholic song with an operatic, cinematic, and emotional feel. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
In the shadows of the evening,
Whispers dance like fading dreams.

[chorus]
Echoes of a silent sorrow,
A velvet night, a moonlessorrow.

[bridge]
Through the mist, a lone figure weaves,
Carrying tales of ancient beliefs.
