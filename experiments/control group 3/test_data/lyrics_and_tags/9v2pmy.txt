Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows, I find my place,
A rebel heart in a longing embrace.

[chorus]
Unique in the dark, I stand alone,
With a reflective soul, in a world unknown.

[verse]
Echoes of dreams, whispering free,
Chasing the unique melody.

[chorus]
Unique in the dark, I stand alone,
With a reflective soul, in a world unknown.

[bridge]
Breaking chains, setting free,
The rebellion calls, can you hear me?

[anthem]
One in a million, a spark in the night,
Igniting the sky with an anthemic light.
Standing out from the crowd, making our mark,
One in a million, setting the park.

[chorus]
Unique in the dark, I stand alone,
With a reflective soul, in a world unknown.
