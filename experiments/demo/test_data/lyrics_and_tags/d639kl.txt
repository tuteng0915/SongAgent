cashier sound, smooth jazz guitar, echoing money lyrics, vocal, chill, groovy, lazy Sunday afternoon
Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the store, hear the beep
Cashier's counting, as I creep
[chorus]
Money, money, echoing tonight
In the rhythm of the cash machine's delight
[bridge]
Sunday's here, no need to rush
Smooth tunes and good vibes, that's our hush
