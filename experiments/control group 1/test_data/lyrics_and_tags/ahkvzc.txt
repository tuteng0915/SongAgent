Lyrics :
[intro]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...

[verse 1]
Female Singer: Walking down the aisle, got my basket in hand,
Got a list that I made but I don't really need a plan,
The lights they flicker, and the wheels keep spinning,
I'm lost in the beats coming from the speakers within in.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: This beat's got me moving, no time to pretend,
Every corner I turn, it's like I'm at the weekend,
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: I'm caught in the rhythm, can't you feel it my friend?

[verse 2]
Female Singer: Cereal boxes and magazines, neon signs above,
In this supermarket symphony, falling head over heels in love,
With the vibe so electric, it's lifting me higher,
A grocery store gala with every single flyer.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: This beat's got me swaying, like I'm on a parade,
Each section I dance through, like it's a masquerade,
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: It's a shopping spree serenade, it's more than just trade.

[bridge]
Female Singer: The carts become partners, the aisles our ballroom floor,
Who needs a fancy club when we've got something more?
Together we'll waltz in this neon delight,
Until the morning comes breaking, ending our night.

[chorus]
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: This beat's got me rocking, it's an all-night sway,
Under fluorescent stars, till the break of day,
Male Voice: Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Female Singer: With every step forward, it feels just like play.
