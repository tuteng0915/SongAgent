User : 
Hey there! I want to create a song that fits the following description:  

It should be a mid-late 2000s rock song with a mellow vibe. The theme of the lyrics should evoke an underwater, dreamlike, and slightly psychedelic atmosphere—imagine two girls living in a surreal aquatic world within their own apartment. There’s a subtle romantic undertone between them, but it's not explicitly stated. Oh, and the singer should have a male voice.  

Can you generate something like this for me?

[verse]  
In this submerged sanctuary we find  
Two hearts adrift in an endless tide  
Shadows dance on the ocean floor  
A world unknown lies within our door  

[chorus]  
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky  
We drift together, you and I  
No need for words beneath the waves  
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save  

[verse]  
Neon corals light up the night  
Reflections shimmering out of sight  
Our fingers brush as we navigate  
This maze of memories we create  

[chorus]  
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky  
We drift together, you and I  
No need for words beneath the waves  
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save  

[bridge]  
The surface feels so far away  
But here below, we've found our stay  
Where time dissolves like grains of sand  
And dreams take shape at every hand  

[chorus]  
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky  
We drift together, you and I  
No need for words beneath the waves  
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save  

[outro]  
Fading whispers, the current takes  
A love unspoken, the silence makes  
An endless loop, no start or end  
Forever yours, forever my friend
