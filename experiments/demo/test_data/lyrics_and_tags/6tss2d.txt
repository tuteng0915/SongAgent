Lyrics :
[intro]
Voice mimicking a phone ringing
Dialogue: "I know she's home."
"Hello?"
"Hey, it's me. I've got some news."

[verse 1]
Walking down this lonely street
Thinking 'bout the words you said
I can hear your voice so clear
But it's not enough to keep my hopes here

[chorus]
Bad news on the telephone line
Cutting deeper than a knife
I was hoping for a different tale
But reality hits and love turns pale

[verse 2]
The city lights are fading fast
Memories of us won't last
I should've seen this coming
Now I'm stuck in this endless humming

[chorus]
Bad news on the telephone line
Cutting deeper than a knife
I was hoping for a different tale
But reality hits and love turns pale

[bridge]
Every dial tone echoes pain
Every ring brings another stain
On the heart that used to be mine
Now it's shattered into pieces by the cruel design

[chorus]
Bad news on the telephone line
Cutting deeper than a knife
I was hoping for a different tale
But reality hits and love turns pale

[outro]
Fade out with the busy signal
