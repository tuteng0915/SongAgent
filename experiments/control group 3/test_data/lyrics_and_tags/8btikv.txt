Lyrics :
[verse] In the heart of Africa, where rhythm's never wrong,
Fela's saxophone sings freedom’s song.
Manu’s funky groove, like a warm summer breeze,
Together they dance through the mystic trees.

[chorus] Oh, Africa! Your beats so bold,
In every corner, your stories told.
From Lagos to Paris, the vibes align,
Afrobeat forever, timeless shine.

[verse] Underneath the stars, where night turns to day,
Rhythms collide on the Milky Way.
With boots on the ground, we march as one,
To the beat of the drum, till the morning sun.

[chorus] Oh, Africa! Your beats so bold,
In every corner, your stories told.
From Lagos to Paris, the vibes align,
Afrobeat forever, timeless shine.

[bridge] Feel the pulse, it’s in your soul,
African heartbeat makes us whole.
Through trials and triumphs, we keep it strong,
This is our music, where we belong.
