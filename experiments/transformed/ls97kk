Hello, song generating agent! I’d like you to create a song based on a concept I have in mind. The song should be in the electronic music genre, and it would be great if it could feature a female vocalist. Here’s the idea for the song:

The setting for the video would be in a mental hospital, where the opening scene shows a patient pointing at a radio saying something eerie like, "They are here, inside the radio," followed by the music swelling up loudly. The video should then transition into scenes of other patients dancing around the hospital.

Please generate lyrics that capture this mysterious yet danceable vibe, with themes that evoke intrigue and a sense of otherworldly presence coming through the airwaves. Let’s aim for an ethereal and slightly unsettling atmosphere while keeping the energy high enough for people to want to dance.

Looking forward to what you come up with!
