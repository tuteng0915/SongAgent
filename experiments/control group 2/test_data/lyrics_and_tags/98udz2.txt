Lyrics :
[verse]
I've loved you from the start,
That's a fact.
My heart knew when we met,
That's a guess.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.

[verse]
Together we'll create our story,
That's a pact.
Our journey filled with joy and glory,
That's exact.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight,
You are my beacon, my guiding light.
With every moment, with every chance,
I'll hold you close in this dance.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.
