Lyrics :
[verse]
In the desert heat, shadows fall,
Boots on the ground, hear the call.
Marching forward with a purpose in mind,
To the rhythm of the war that we're about to find.

[chorus]
Feel like a cannonball in the chest,
In the theater of war, we're put to the test.
Metal and muscle in the blazing sun,
Iraq-era soldiers, the battle has begun.

[verse]
Camouflage hearts, armed to the teeth,
In this dance of chaos, where it's hard to breathe.
We seek the truth through the smoke and flame,
In the annals of history, some will know our name.

[bridge]
Grenades and guitars, strings of fate,
In the heart of conflict, we resonate.
With every scream and every shout,
It's an orchestra of power and doubt.

[chorus]
Feel like a cannonball in the chest,
In the theater of war, we're put to the test.
Metal and muscle in the blazing sun,
Iraq-era soldiers, the battle has begun.
