Hey song generator, I need a tune that's got a cashier sound at the start, with smooth jazz guitar and echoing "money" lyrics. Can you do that?

Sure, I can create a song with those elements. To ensure it matches your taste, could you please specify if you prefer instrumental or vocal-heavy music? Also, do you have any preferred tempo or mood for the song?
User : 
I think it should be more on the vocal side, but not too much. And make it chill and groovy, like a lazy Sunday afternoon.

I've set up the song with a cashier sound at the start, smooth jazz guitar, and the theme of echoing "money" lyrics. The vibe is chill and groovy, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Here's a snippet of the lyrics:

[verse]
Walking through the store, hear the beep
Cashier's counting, as I creep

[chorus]
Money, money, echoing tonight
In the rhythm of the cash machine's delight

[bridge]
Sunday's here, no need to rush
Smooth tunes and good vibes, that's our hush

Press the "generate" button to create the song.
