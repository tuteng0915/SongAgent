User : 
Sure thing! Let's get started on crafting that song. To begin, could you give me a simple idea of what the main theme or emotion of the song should be?
Agent : 
Sure! To better understand your preferences, I'll first gather some information about the style and mood you're aiming for.



the user has not given their preferences yet.
Got it! Since you haven't specified your preferences yet, let's go with a general approach. We can always tweak it later based on your feedback.

Let's start by setting some tags and initial lyrics for the song. I'll begin with a theme of "love and adventure," which often resonates well.

I'll set the tags and draft the initial lyrics now.

I've set the theme of the song to "love and adventure," with tags that include "upbeat," "romantic," and "exciting." Here are the initial lyrics:

```
[verse]
We set out on this journey, hearts open wide
Every step we take, with love as our guide

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold

[verse]
The path may twist, the night may fall
But with you by my side, I'll never stall

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold

[bridge]
Hand in hand, we brave the unknown
With every heartbeat, our love has grown

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold
```
