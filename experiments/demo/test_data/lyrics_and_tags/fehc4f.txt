Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the night,
I feel your presence, it burns so bright.
Neon lights fade, but you remain,
A ghost in the echoes, love's sweet pain.

[chorus]
I can feeeel you, in every breath I take,
This haunting memory, a figure in the haze.
With every heartbeat, you call my name,
In this lonely world, you're my only flame.

[bridge]
Time stands still when you're near,
The world disappears, there's nothing to fear.
We're dancing through time, in this endless race,
Chasing shadows, lost in space.
