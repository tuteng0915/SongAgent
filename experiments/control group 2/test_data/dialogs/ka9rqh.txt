I'd like to generate an old country song about a cowboy who's on the run from the law, desperately searching for his woman. In the end, he gets shot and falls from his horse, and as he lays dying, the woman he loves holds him in her arms. Can you create that song for me?

I've crafted your old country song about a cowboy on the run. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Riding through the night, stars above my head
The law's behind me and a price on my head
Searching for my woman, she's the only one
Who can ease this pain when the day is done

[chorus]
Oh, my darling, where can you be?
The life of an outlaw ain't no place for thee
But I'll ride till my last breath
For just one more moment in your arms before death

[verse]
Every shadow hides a danger, every sound's a threat
I've got no friends left, and my time ain't met
The moonlight guides me as I seek her face
In this wild frontier, there's no other place

[chorus]
Oh, my darling, where can you be?
The life of an outlaw ain't no place for thee
But I'll ride till my last breath
For just one more moment in your arms before death

[bridge]
A shot rings out, I feel the burn
My faithful horse beneath me starts to turn
I fall into the dust, my vision fades
But then I see her, running through the glades

[final chorus]
Oh, my darling, now you're here
Hold me close, wipe away my tear
As life leaves me, I feel at peace
For your love's embrace is my final release
