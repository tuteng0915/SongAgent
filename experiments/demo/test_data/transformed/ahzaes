Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on these details. It’s an upbeat, fast-paced pop song by a female singer, and it would have been released around 2002. The vibe of the song is kind of cold or autumnal, with a music video that features a collage of photos. The chorus has lyrics along the lines of "and life is too shorrrt to something something forrr youuuu." 

Can you create a song that fits this description?
