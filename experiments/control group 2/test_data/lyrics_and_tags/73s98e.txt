Lyrics :
[verse]
If only you knew, that you could
Make a change in your neighborhood
You're the one who's got the power
To shine like a supernova

[pre-chorus]
Bass guitar solo with powerful riffs and driving beat

[chorus]
We're all counting on you
To make it through
Together we can make a difference
In this world tonight

[verse]
Every step you take, every move you make
We're watching you, we're rooting for you
Don't be afraid to take a stand
Raise your voice, make a demand

[pre-chorus]
Bass guitar solo with powerful riffs and driving beat

[chorus]
We're all counting on you
To make it through
Together we can make a difference
In this world tonight

[bridge]
Electric guitar riff with melodic vocals
Emotional lyrics that tug at the heartstrings

[chorus]
We're all counting on you
To make it through
Together we can make a difference
In this world tonight
