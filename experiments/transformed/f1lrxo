Hello, song generating agent! I need your help to create a song based on the following requirements:

I'm looking for a song with an emo/pop-punk sound, reminiscent of Fall Out Boy, from around 2007. The song should have a line about putting buckets on their heads to keep the zombies from eating their brains or something similar. Can you generate a song that meets these criteria?
