Great! We have set the tags for a slow, soulful, emotional, and melodic song. Now, let me know if you have any specific themes or lyrics in mind for this tune. It could be about love, loss, hope, or anything else that resonates with you. This will help me craft lyrics that truly capture the essence of your vision. If you don't have any specific ideas, I can suggest some themes that might fit well. What do you think?
User : 
The song should be about deep affection, with lines that express love directly. Something along the lines of "baby I love you, I really love you." It'd be great if it felt heartfelt and sincere.
Agent : 
That's a wonderful direction. I'll draft some lyrics that convey deep affection and sincerity, incorporating lines similar to what you've suggested. Let's create a few sections for the song: verse, chorus, and bridge.

I will now generate the initial lyrics.

The lyrics have been set to reflect deep affection and sincerity. Here's a preview of the song structure:

[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I whisper your name
Every heartbeat echoes, Baby I love you, I really love you

[chorus]
With every breath, with all my soul
I'm holding on to you, never let go
You're my forever, my guiding light
Baby I love you, I really love you

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight
Our love remains, burning so bright

[chorus]
With every breath, with all my soul
I'm holding on to you, never let go
You're my forever, my guiding light
Baby I love you, I really love you

The lyrics are coming along nicely, but I imagine harmonies would add a lot to the song. Could we incorporate sections where other singers repeat the word "stay"? It could enhance the emotional impact.
Agent : 
Adding harmonies with the word "stay" is a fantastic idea to enhance the emotional impact of the song. I'll incorporate a harmony section where other singers repeat "stay" in the background.

Let's add this to the bridge section for an added layer of depth and emotion.

The lyrics have been updated to include a harmony section in the bridge where other singers softly repeat the word "stay." Here's how the revised bridge looks:

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight
Our love remains, burning so bright
(Stay... stay...)
Harmonies linger softly, repeating 'stay'

The song is shaping up to be just what I wanted. It feels like it could be performed by a male vocal group, maybe something akin to The Temptations. Do you think we're ready to generate the final version?
Agent : 
Absolutely, it sounds like we have a solid foundation for the song. Given your preference for a style similar to The Temptations, I'll ensure the tags reflect that style to guide the final generation process.

Let's update the tags to include this stylistic direction.
