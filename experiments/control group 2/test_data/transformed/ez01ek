Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song based on some features I remember from a song I once heard. The song should have female vocals and be in the pop-rock genre, ideally released in the 2000s. The theme of the song revolves around outcasts and troubled, mostly young, people.

Each verse should tell the story of a different person. One particular verse should focus on a boy who is unsure if he is a boy or a girl, and this uncertainty should be reflected in the lyrics without being a direct quote. 

Could you generate such a song for me?
