Lyrics :
[intro]
ba ba ba baaaaa

[verse 1]
I can make (something something...) 

[chorus]
In this moment, time stands still,
Our eyes meet, I feel the thrill.
Heartbeats echo, love unfolds,
In this dream, my heart you hold. 

[verse 2]
Every glance, a sweet surprise,
In your gaze, I see the skies.
Whispers softly, promises made,
In this dance, no shade of gray.

[chorus]
In this moment, time stands still,
Our eyes meet, I feel the thrill.
Heartbeats echo, love unfolds,
In this dream, my heart you hold.

[bridge]
Oh, the silence speaks our names,
In this night, we light the flames.
No words needed, love's so clear,
In this scene, I disappear.

[chorus]
In this moment, time stands still,
Our eyes meet, I feel the thrill.
Heartbeats echo, love unfolds,
In this dream, my heart you hold.
