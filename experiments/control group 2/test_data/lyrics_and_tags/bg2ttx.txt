Lyrics :
[Intro]
Dreamy synths and a gentle beat set the stage for reflection.

[Verse 1]
Pedal karts racing down the lane,
Swings in the air, feeling so plane,
Laughter echoing, a distant chime,
Echoes of youth, in the nick of time.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we were kids just yesterday,
Now we're here, where did it stray?

[Chorus]
We're the children of yesteryear,
Growing up with every cheer,
Kicking balls and riding high,
In the sky where dreams comply.

[Verse 2]
Remember when the world stood still,
Every moment was a thrill,
Climbing trees and chasing rain,
Never knowing of adult pain.

[Bridge]
But as the days turn into years,
We hold on tight to childish fears,
Forgetting not the paths we tread,
As we journey where life has led.

[Chorus]
We're the children of yesteryear,
Finding our way through doubt and fear,
Building castles out of sand,
In a wonderland that won't withstand.

[Outro]
The echoes fade but memories stay,
Guiding us through each brand new day.
