Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been lost in the shadows
Falling deeper every day
The weight of this world's too heavy
There's no light to lead the way

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning
Caught inside this endless fight
Bring me back to life again
Before I fade into the night

[verse 2]
Silent cries echo louder
A soul on fire, burning cold
No escape from these chains that bind me
In this void, I've lost control

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning
Caught inside this endless fight
Bring me back to life again
Before I fade into the night

[bridge]
The clock is ticking faster now
Every breath feels like my last
Will you pull me through before it's over?
Or am I destined to be past
