Alright, let's transform this into a request for the song-generating agent.

**My Request:**  
I want you to generate a song that captures the essence of 90s East Coast Hip-Hop. The lyrics should include the line *"…from the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver…"*. The beat needs to be boom bap-style, with that classic 90s gritty and soulful vibe. Keep it authentic to the era while giving it your own creative twist. Let’s go!

I have generated a song that captures the essence of 90s East Coast Hip-Hop with a boom bap-style beat and soulful vibe. The lyrics include your specified line and convey an authentic yet creatively twisted feel of the era. 

Here are the sections:

[verse]
...from the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver...

[chorus]
Classic beats in the air, feel the vibe so rare
East Coast tales we share, stories beyond compare

[bridge]
Gritty streets and soulful nights, under neon lights
Creative rhymes take flight, reaching new heights

[verse 2]
In this era of sound, where legends are found
Boom bap echoes around, as feet leave the ground
