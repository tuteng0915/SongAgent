Hello, song generating agent! I need your help to create a song that matches the following description:  

It should be an upbeat pop/synth pop track with a lively and steady drumbeat that keeps the energy high throughout. In the chorus, there should be quick ascending piano chords that give it a dynamic and uplifting feel. The overall vibe should evoke a sleek, neon-lit nighttime atmosphere—something that feels modern yet retro, like a dazzling cityscape under electric lights. The singer should be male, with a smooth and charismatic vocal style reminiscent of Robert Palmer.  

Can you generate a song like this for me? Let’s call it "Neon Pulse."
