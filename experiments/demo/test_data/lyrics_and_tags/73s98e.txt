Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the morning light,
Felt the rush of the day taking flight.
Every step that I take, feels so right,
Living life with no time to fight.

[pre-chorus]
Bass riff here, setting the groove,
Feel the beat, let it prove.

[chorus]
If only you knew, that you could,
Change the world with all the good.
Rise above and break the hood,
If only you knew, that you could.

[verse]
Walking down the streets of hope and dreams,
Seeing visions in the moonlight beams.
With every heartbeat, the spirit gleams,
In this journey, nothingâ€™s as it seems.

[bridge]
Turn around, see the faces,
In the crowd, find your places.
Feel the power, hear the voices,
In this moment, everyone rejoices.

[chorus]
If only you knew, that you could,
Change the world with all the good.
Rise above and break the hood,
If only you knew, that you could.
