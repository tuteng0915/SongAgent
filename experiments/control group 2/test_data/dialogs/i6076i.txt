Hey there! I need your help to generate a song. Here's what I'm thinking:  

It should be by a band, not a solo artist, with a rock/pop vibe—definitely not a ballad, but also not too fast. The theme of the song is about unrequited love, where the guy feels like he’s stuck in the friendzone. He’s pouring out his feelings while the girl remains oblivious to them, almost like she doesn’t see or understand how much he cares for her. It’s kind of bittersweet and has that "big friendzone energy."

[verse]  
I've been standing here in the shadows  
Watching you shine, it's all I can do  
You light up the room, but you don't even know my name  
Stuck in this place where we're just friends again  

[chorus]  
But I'm more than a friend, can't you see?  
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me  
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible  
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself  

[verse]  
Every laugh we share cuts deeper than before  
It feels like I'm screaming, but you don't hear a sound  
I write you letters that I'll never send  
Hoping someday you'll see, this isn't how it ends  

[chorus]  
But I'm more than a friend, can't you see?  
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me  
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible  
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself  

[bridge]  
If only you'd look closer, past the guard I hold tight  
Maybe then you'd find the truth hiding beneath  
But until that day, I'll wear this quiet pain  
Smiling through the heartache, playing our same game  

[chorus]  
'Cause I'm more than a friend, can't you see?  
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me  
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible  
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself  

[outro]  
So here's to us, stuck in this loop  
Forever friends, while my heart breaks in two
