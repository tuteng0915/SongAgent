Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on these requirements. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want the song to start with a spoken-word intro, where a guy is talking angstily over some guitar strumming. He’s venting about a girl who cheated on him or did something really hurtful. He might say something along the lines of, “There’s rules, you don’t do this and you don’t do that!” or “When a guy likes you and gives you his heart, you don’t go and throw it all away!”—you know, something super angsty and raw. This spoken part should last for about 15 seconds.

Then, it transitions into the actual song, which keeps that same emotional tone—angsty, upset, maybe even a little bitter. The lyrics should reflect betrayal, heartbreak, and frustration, but also have a sense of reclaiming power or coping with the pain. 

Think you can whip that up? Let’s hear it!
