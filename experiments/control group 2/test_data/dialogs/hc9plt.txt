Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I need you to generate a mellow, smooth acoustic guitar-driven song with English lyrics that could be sung by a Hispanic artist. The song should include the phrases "I can't believe it," "can you feel it," "ohhhh but I —-" and "in the world to realize." Keep the tone emotional and reflective, capturing a sense of introspection and wonder. Let’s create something that feels like it could fit into Marc Anthony's style if he were singing in English.

    **[verse]**  
    I can't believe it, the way the sun sets in hues  
    Can you feel it, like morning dews?  
    Every moment feels borrowed, yet so true  
    In this world to realize, dreams do renew  

    **[chorus]**  
    Ohhhh but I —- hold on to the past  
    While stepping into the unknown so vast  
    With every heartbeat, with every sigh  
    I find my way under the open sky  

    **[verse]**  
    Walking paths less traveled, feeling free  
    I can't believe it's taken all this time to see  
    The beauty hidden in the simplest of things  
    A melody played on love's gentle strings  

    **[chorus]**  
    Ohhhh but I —- embrace what I've found  
    In the silence between the heartbeats profound  
    Can you feel it? A connection so deep  
    In the world to realize, secrets we keep  

    **[bridge]**  
    Through trials and triumphs, through joy and pain  
    Life unfolds like a sweet refrain  
    Each note a story, each song a memory  
    Together they weave our tapestry
