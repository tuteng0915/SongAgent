Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echo of the clinking chains,
I find the silence in my pain.

[chorus]
The machine keeps on turning,
While my heart keeps on yearning.
For the touch that's lost in time,
A memory, a sacred shrine.

[verse]
Steel and sorrow intertwine,
As each gear ticks off the sign.

[chorus]
The machine keeps on turning,
While my heart keeps on yearning.
For the moments torn apart,
Leaving echoes in my heart.

[bridge]
Amidst the clamor, I hear your name,
A whisper soft, like gentle rain.
Yet in this factory of endless night,
You're but a shadow, out of sight.
