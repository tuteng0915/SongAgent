Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate a song that captures the essence of nostalgia and the transition from childhood to adulthood. The song should be a blend of pop and rap styles, reminiscent of the vibe given by MGMT's "Kids." The lyrics should reflect on the singers' memories of being young and their thoughts about growing up. 

To align with the visual concept I have in mind, imagine an intro that sets a dreamy yet playful tone, similar to the beginning of "Kids" by MGMT. The song should also incorporate themes or keywords related to youth, such as 'child,' 'kid,' and 'younger.'

Please generate the lyrics and any relevant tags for this song, keeping in mind the fun and carefree atmosphere of children playing in a playground, enjoying swings, and riding pedal karts.

[Intro]
Dreamy synths and a gentle beat set the stage for reflection.

[Verse 1]
Pedal karts racing down the lane,
Swings in the air, feeling so plane,
Laughter echoing, a distant chime,
Echoes of youth, in the nick of time.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we were kids just yesterday,
Now we're here, where did it stray?

[Chorus]
We're the children of yesteryear,
Growing up with every cheer,
Kicking balls and riding high,
In the sky where dreams comply.

[Verse 2]
Remember when the world stood still,
Every moment was a thrill,
Climbing trees and chasing rain,
Never knowing of adult pain.

[Bridge]
But as the days turn into years,
We hold on tight to childish fears,
Forgetting not the paths we tread,
As we journey where life has led.

[Chorus]
We're the children of yesteryear,
Finding our way through doubt and fear,
Building castles out of sand,
In a wonderland that won't withstand.

[Outro]
The echoes fade but memories stay,
Guiding us through each brand new day.
