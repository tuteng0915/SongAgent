Hey, I'd like a song that feels like the end of an 80's coming of age story, you know? And can we have the line "and the seasons chaaahange!" in there? Something with a mix of Elvis and Morrissey vibes. What else do you need to know?
Agent : 
To create a song that captures the essence of an 80's coming-of-age story with a blend of Elvis and Morrissey vibes, I'll go ahead and set some tags to guide the generation process. Given your request for a particular lyrical line, I will also draft some original sections to incorporate "and the seasons chaaahange!" into the song. Let me handle the details for you.

I will now set the parameters for the tags and lyrics.
