Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I whisper your name
Every heartbeat echoes, Baby I love you, I really love you

[chorus]
With every breath, with all my soul
I'm holding on to you, never let go
You're my forever, my guiding light
Baby I love you, I really love you

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight
Our love remains, burning so bright
(Stay... stay...)
Harmonies linger softly, repeating 'stay'

[chorus]
With every breath, with all my soul
I'm holding on to you, never let go
You're my forever, my guiding light
Baby I love you, I really love you
