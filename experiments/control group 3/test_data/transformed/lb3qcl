Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique challenge for you. Based on the details I'm about to provide, I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of what I'm looking for instead of finding an existing one. Here's what I need:

- The song should feature a repetitive, rustic, mid-range violin line that leans more towards a minor, melancholic tone rather than a major, upbeat one.
- It should be set in the late 90s to early 2000s "adult" pop and alternative style, reminiscent of artists like Lisa Loeb, Paula Cole, and Barenaked Ladies.
- The song ideally includes female vocals, fitting into the laid-back vibe with a prominent violin line akin to "Tom's Diner" by Suzanne Vega but not necessarily electronic or trip-hop.
- The overall sound should capture the "90s" feelâ€”somewhat drab yet catchy enough for radio play.

Could you craft a song that fits this description? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
