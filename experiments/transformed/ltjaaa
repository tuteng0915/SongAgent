Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song based on some details I remember from my childhood. The song is about a mother who faces hardships but keeps persevering, finding small treasures like gems or grain for her daughter while walking along the roadside. There might be a line about painful shoes, though I’m not entirely sure. It was performed by a popular female artist and accompanied primarily by a violin. Can you create something in that vein? I’d love it to capture the same emotional depth and beauty of the original memory I have.
