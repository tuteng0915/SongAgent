Lyrics :
[Intro]
Naa nananana... 
La la la...

[Verse 1]
Walking down these streets I've known,
Memories like whispers in the stone.
Every corner holds a song,
Of the good old days that didn't last long.

[Chorus]
Oh, those golden days,
With the sun on our face,
We danced under starlit skies,
In the warmth of each other's eyes.

[Verse 2]
Guitar strings hum with tales untold,
Of friendships strong and dreams so bold.
Each note a memory we hold dear,
Echoing through time, always near.

[Chorus]
Oh, those golden days,
With the sun on our face,
We danced under starlit skies,
In the warmth of each other's eyes.

[Bridge]
And though the road may wind and wander,
The soul of rock will guide us yonder.
Through every high and every low,
The music plays where'er we go.

[Outro]
Naa nananana... 
La la la...
