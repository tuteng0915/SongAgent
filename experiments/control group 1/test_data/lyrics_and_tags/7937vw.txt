Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the night
We find our way through the fight

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry

[verse]
Every step, every fall
We'll break free, stand tall

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry

[bridge]
Together we stand, hearts in hand
Facing the world, we make our stand

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry
