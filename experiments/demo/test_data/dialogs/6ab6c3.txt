I want to create a song with a late 90s or early 2000s alternative/grunge vibe. Can we start with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's set the tags for the song to capture the late 90s or early 2000s alternative/grunge vibe. I'll go ahead and set those tags now.

Great! We've set the tags to capture that alternative/grunge vibe from the late 90s or early 2000s. Now, let's work on some lyrics. Do you have any specific themes or topics in mind for the song? If not, I can suggest something fitting for the genre.
User : 
The song should have a memorable part where the singer sings "controlling me." Can we include that?
Agent : 
Absolutely, we can include that memorable part in the song. Let's create some lyrics with a section that highlights "controlling me." I'll draft up the lyrics now.

I've included the part where the singer sings "controlling me" in the chorus. Here's how the lyrics look so far:

[verse]
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The streets are empty, they're calling my name
I'm losing track of who I used to be
There's something whispering inside of me

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

[verse]
Faded dreams on the edge of town
Silent screams getting louder now
I'm searching for a place to breathe
Caught in the web you weave so easily

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

[bridge]
The struggle is real when I'm face to face
With shadows of doubt that I can't erase
But I'll find my way through this mystery
Even as you keep on controlling me

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

The singer should have a high-pitched voice. Can we add that detail?

The overall mood should evoke that era's animation style, edgy and otherworldly. Maybe include some alien-related imagery?
Agent : 
To capture the edgy and otherworldly mood reminiscent of that era's animation style, I'll incorporate some alien-related imagery into the lyrics. Let's update the lyrics to reflect this new direction.

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The streets are empty, they're calling my name

[verse]
Faded dreams on the edge of town
Silent screams getting louder now
Alien signals, they call to me
In this strange land, where nothing is free

You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key

Amongst the stars, I see your face
An alien grace, I'm lost in space
Forever bound by unseen ties
In this cosmic dance, you're controlling me
