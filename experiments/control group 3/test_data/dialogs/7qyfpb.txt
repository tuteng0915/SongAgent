I want a song that feels like 90s East Coast Hip-Hop, with a gritty vibe and some soul. Think boom bap beats and sharp lyrics. Can you work with that?

Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular themes or subjects you'd like the lyrics to cover? Also, do you prefer a specific structure for the song, like the order of verses and choruses?
User : 
I'd like the lyrics to capture the raw energy of the streets and maybe touch on some social issues from that era. As for the structure, just keep it classic—verses, chorus, and a hook that sticks. How's that sound?

I've crafted some lyrics and set the tags to match your vision of a 90s East Coast Hip-Hop track. The gritty vibe and soul are reflected in both the lyrics and the style we're aiming for. 

Here's what I came up with:

[verse]
Concrete jungle, where the hustlers unite,
Underneath the streetlights, in the city's fight.
Voices echo loud, like a symphony of plight,
But there's beauty in the struggle, shining through the night.

[chorus]
Boom bap beats, soulful and deep,
Every rhyme we spit, secrets that we keep.
The pulse of the city, in our veins it runs,
Gritty tales of glory, sung by the unsung ones.

[verse]
Social threads unravel, stories untold,
Injustice painted bold, on every face, so cold.
We rise from the ashes, with dreams to be sold,
A testament to time, as legends unfold.

[bridge]
Echoes of the past, in every heartbeat,
Rhythms intertwine, where souls meet.
Keep your head held high, though skies may seem gray,
For every drop of rain, brings a brighter day.

Press the "generate" button when you're ready to create the song.

The lyrics you've generated are tight, but I forgot to mention I want the line *"…from the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver…"* included. Can we add that in somewhere? Maybe tweak a verse or the hook to fit it in naturally?

I've updated the lyrics to include the line you mentioned. It's now part of the chorus, adding a unique twist while keeping the flow natural. Here's how it reads now:

[chorus]
Boom bap beats, soulful and deep,
Every rhyme we spit, secrets that we keep.
From the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver,
The pulse of the city, in our veins it runs,
Gritty tales of glory, sung by the unsung ones.

The lyrics are looking solid. I think we're almost there. Just one more thing—can you tweak the beat to make sure it's got that classic boom bap style? You know, something that really knocks. After that, I think we're good to go.
Agent : 
To ensure the beat aligns with the classic boom bap style you're looking for, I'll emphasize that in the tags which guide the instrumental production. I'll adjust the tags to sharpen the focus on crafting a powerful boom bap rhythm.

Once this is done, we can generate the final version of the song. Let's proceed with updating the tags.
