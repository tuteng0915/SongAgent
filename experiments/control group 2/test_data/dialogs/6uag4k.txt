Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I need you to generate a song that matches these features: it should feel driven and rhythmic, with an almost industrial or mechanical sound—like a clinking chain in a steady beat: BOOM, CLINK, BOOM, CLINK. Over this relentless rhythm, there needs to be a female vocalist singing somberly about themes of loss and longing. The tone should evoke emotion, as if it could belong in a powerful movie trailer scene. Let’s create something that captures this mood and energy.

I have generated a song that matches your requested features. The tags include "driven, rhythmic, industrial, mechanical, somber, female vocalist, loss, longing, movie trailer" to reflect the mood and energy you're looking for.

Here are the lyrics I've crafted:

```
[verse]
In the shadows where silence grows
A heart of steel begins to close
Every echo of a memory fades
Clinging to the chains that bind us here

[chorus]
Lost in the rhythm of your name
BOOM CLINK echoes through the pain
Longing for a touch so frail
In this endless industrial trail

[verse]
The clinking chains, they never rest
Each beat a scar upon my chest
I sing to you from worlds apart
Hoping my voice finds your heart

[bridge]
And if the world should fall away
Our song will rise from the decay
We'll find each other in the dark
Guided by love's eternal spark

[chorus]
Lost in the rhythm of your name
BOOM CLINK echoes through the pain
Longing for a touch so frail
In this endless industrial trail
```
