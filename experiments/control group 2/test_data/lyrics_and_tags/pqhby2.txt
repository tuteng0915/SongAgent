Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of a frozen glade,
Where whispers of winter cascade,
A lone figure wanders through white,
Beneath the moon's pale light.

[chorus]
Oh, solitude, in snow you confide,
A dance of shadows where secrets hide,
Yet within this icy embrace,
Burns a fire no frost can erase.

[verse 2]
Branches creak and snap with disdain,
As echoes of silence go in vain,
Clouded thoughts like storms convene,
Nature herself begins to grieve.

[bridge]
The calm shatters, the winds roar,
Ashes rise from the cold floor,
Flames now lick at the frozen skies,
A phoenix reborn as the blizzard dies.

[chorus 2]
From solitude, a tempest grows,
Contrasts collide as fervor explodes,
What was once ice is now a flame,
In this forest, only echoes remain.

[final section]
Screaming out the pain, setting soul ablaze,
I am the storm, through smoke and haze,
No chains to bind, no fear to hold,
The night is dark but I'm pure gold.
