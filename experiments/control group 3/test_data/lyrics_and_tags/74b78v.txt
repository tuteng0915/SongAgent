Lyrics :
[verse]
On winding roads where shadows play,
I wander lone at close of day.
Each step I take, a fleeting trace,
Of dreams that lead me through this maze.

[chorus]
Oh, distant light, guide my way,
Through endless nights to break of day.
With every high, with every low,
The path unfolds, where hearts may go.

[verse]
Beneath the stars, so vast, so wide,
A whispered call I cannot hide.
Though lost I've been, I still believe,
In what awaits around the bend.

[bridge]
Sometimes the road is steep and long,
Yet in my heart, I hear a song.
A melody both bright and deep,
It calls me forth from where I sleep.

[chorus]
Oh, distant light, guide my way,
Through endless nights to break of day.
With every high, with every low,
The path unfolds, where hearts may go.
