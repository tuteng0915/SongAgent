Here's a possible lyrical structure for your song:
[Verse]
Walking on the moon in my dreams again
Neon lights are blinding as they beam and bend
We dance like shadows in an endless night
Under the spell of the stars' soft light

[Chorus]
Take me higher, like a satellite
Dancing in the echoes of the twilight
Electric hearts, they never lie
Together we will touch the sky

[Bridge]
Sunrise visions in kaleidoscopes
Every color's bursting with hope
Hold onto this feeling so tight
As we ride the morning light
