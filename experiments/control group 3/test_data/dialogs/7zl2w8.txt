User : 
I want a song that starts with some cool movie quotes and then goes into some heavy rock music. Can you do that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Do you have any specific movie quotes in mind that you would like to start the song with? Also, could you specify what kind of heavy rock music you prefer? For example, do you want it to sound like classic rock, metal, or something more modern? This will help me tailor the song to your tastes. If you're not sure, I can suggest some popular options.
User : 
Yeah, I want it to start with these quotes: "I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus." and "Could you describe the ruckus?" Just make the rock music super intense, with screaming vocals too.

[Verse 1]
In the dead of night, shadows come alive,
Whispers through the dark, secrets start to thrive.
The air is thick with tales of old,
Legends never die, they turn to gold.

[Chorus]
Scream it out loud, let the demons hear,
We're the chaos that's closing in, have no fear.
With every beat, we rise above,
This is our time, this is our love.

[Bridge]
Feel the rush, it's electric,
Every moment so cinematic.
Our hearts collide like thunder,
Breaking free from chains that bind us under.

[Chorus]
Scream it out loud, let the demons hear,
We're the chaos that's closing in, have no fear.
With every beat, we rise above,
This is our time, this is our love.

[Outro]
As the echoes fade into the night,
The ruckus turns to silence, but we hold tight.
