Lyrics :
[spoken-word intro]
There’s rules, you don’t do this and you don’t do that!
When a guy likes you and gives you his heart,
you don’t go and throw it all away like it means nothing!
That’s not how this works, that’s not how any of this works!

[verse 1]
I gave you my world, but you tore it apart,
Left me with scars and a shattered heart.
Thought we were real, thought we had a plan,
But you played me for a fool, just another man.

[chorus]
You broke the rules, now I’m breaking free,
No more chains, no more misery.
I’ll rise from the ashes, stronger than before,
This pain is mine, but I won’t want it anymore.

[verse 2]
Every word you said was a dagger in disguise,
Cutting deeper as I looked into your lies.
I gave you trust, but you let it fall,
Now I’m standing tall, through it all.

[chorus]
You broke the rules, now I’m breaking free,
No more chains, no more misery.
I’ll rise from the ashes, stronger than before,
This pain is mine, but I won’t want it anymore.

[bridge]
The fire inside burns brighter each day,
It fuels my fight, it lights my way.
Betrayal taught me lessons cold,
But now I’m unstoppable, brave and bold.

[chorus]
You broke the rules, now I’m breaking free,
No more chains, no more misery.
I’ll rise from the ashes, stronger than before,
This pain is mine, but I won’t want it anymore.
