Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I want you to generate a song that has an 80s vibe with a deep, smokey male voice singing about how you can never go wrong with a certain drink—maybe a martini or margarita—or even just stories of picking up girls. The chorus should sound something like this:  
*"You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini."*  
Let’s create a fun, retro track with those elements!

I've set up a fun, retro track with an 80s vibe featuring a deep, smokey male voice. The song is about the timeless charm of a dirty old martini and includes stories of picking up girls in a neon-lit city. Here are the lyrics I've generated:

[verse]
I walked into the bar, lights were dim and low,
A saxophone was playing soft, in this place I know.
The bartender he winked, as he slid me a glass,
It's a dirty old martini, time just seemed to pass.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.

[verse]
She sat at the end of the bar, her eyes locked on mine,
With a smile so wicked, like a secret sign.
We talked about old stories, we laughed until dawn,
And I knew right then, she was the one to spawn.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.

[bridge]
Oh those nights, they roll and sway,
In the haze of smoke and music play.
Where every drink, tells a tale,
Of romance and adventures that never pale.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.
