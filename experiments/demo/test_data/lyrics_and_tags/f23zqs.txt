Lyrics :
[verse]
In the soft glow of twilight's embrace,
Where whispers of love find their place.
Hand in hand, we walk this aisle,
With dreams that forever compile.

[chorus]
Oh, my love, in your eyes I see forever,
A promise made, now and always together.
With every breath, with all that I am,
I'll be yours, under the stars and moon's demand.

[verse]
Velvet skies drape our sacred night,
As hearts entwine in pure delight.
Each moment cherished, memories to keep,
In this journey of love, so deep, so steep.

[bridge]
Through every season, come what may,
Our song will echo, never stray.
With gentle strums of fateâ€™s sweet strings,
Together we'll soar on love's wings.

[chorus]
Oh, my love, in your eyes I see forever,
A promise made, now and always together.
With every breath, with all that I am,
I'll be yours, under the stars and moon's demand.
