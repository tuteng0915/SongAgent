Request to the Song Generating Agent:

Hello, song agent! I have a special request for you. I need you to generate a song that captures the essence of a deeply emotional and melancholic tune. The singer should be female, possessing a smooth, deep voice with occasional raspy undertones. The lyrics should include a part where something is spelled out, possibly involving the letters "C", "B", and "A", but it shouldn't resemble "YMCA". This spelling sequence might form the chorus.

The song should also feature strong drum beats and evoke a sense of hopelessness, perhaps mentioning something about pills. It would be great if the overall atmosphere could conjure imagery of a blonde cheerleader wandering through a gray, desolate room, embodying a feeling of profound despair.

Could you please generate such a song for me? It means a lot, as it ties into a personal narrative I hold dear. Thank you so much for your help!
