Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet room where shadows play,
An old man lies, his hair turned gray.
Memories flicker, like lights that fade,
Within the walls where time has stayed.

[chorus]
Do you remember, the days gone by?
When dreams were young and spirits high.
With every note, her voice takes flight,
A marching band ignites the night.

[bridge]
Flashbacks dance, of laughter sweet,
Of battles fought and hearts that beat.
Dancing on a hillside under skies so wide,
Through fields of gold, through stormy weather,
Moments cherished, binding us forever.
