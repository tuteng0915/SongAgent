Lyrics :
[verse]
Rolling through the city with a funky beat,
Colors all around, feelin' so sweet.
Skateboard dancing, wheels in motion,
Quirky sounds, joyful commotion.

[chorus]
Funky ride, funky day,
Skateboarding all the stress away.
Energy flows, vibrant and free,
In this lively urban symphony.
