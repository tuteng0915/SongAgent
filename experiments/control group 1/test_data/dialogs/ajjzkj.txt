Sure thing! Since you haven't specified any particular themes or elements for the lyrics, I'll just go with the general energetic and fun vibe that matches the style of Fatboy Slim. Let's create something lively and dance-worthy!

I will now set the tags and generate some lyrics for our funky, upbeat tune.

I've set the tags to reflect a funky, upbeat style reminiscent of Fatboy Slim, capturing an energetic and fun vibe. Here are the lyrics I've generated for our song:

```
[verse]
Move your feet to the funky beat
Feel the rhythm, can't be beat
Dance floor's calling, come on complete
Let the music take your seat

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, it's time to dance
Shake it off, give it a chance
Everybody get in the groove
Let's make this party a blast to prove

[verse]
Electric vibes, they light us up
Hands in the air, we can't stop
Spin around, let the bass drop
In this moment, we're non-stop

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, it's time to dance
Shake it off, give it a chance
Everybody get in the groove
Let's make this party a blast to prove

[bridge]
The night is young, so much fun
Underneath the strobe lights, we become
One with the music, lose control
Together we'll rock this golden soul
```
