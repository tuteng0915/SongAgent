Lyrics :
[verse - male]
In the shadow of the old barn's decay
Where whispers of past echo and sway
The wooden beams, once strong, now frail
A silent testament to the toll of tales

[response - female]
I hear your sorrow in every sigh
The echoes of time, they never lie
Amongst these ruins, our memories play
In this dance of shadows, love fades away

[chorus]
Haunting winds sweep through the cracks
Whistling tunes of time's relentless attacks
Memories linger in every creak and groan
Of a place forgotten, yet not alone

[verse - male]
Rustic walls adorned with peeling paint
Windows shattered, like dreamsaints
Nature's embrace slowly pulling down
What man built up, in this forsaken ground

[response - female]
Though nature claims what we can't retain
In my heart, your spirit shall remain
Through every storm, through every pain
Our story lives on, untouched by the rain

[bridge - duet]
And the rain it falls, washing away
Traces of laughter, joy turned gray
Folksy echoes, lost in the air
Angus & Julia's ghostly harmonies pair

[chorus]
Haunting winds sweep through the cracks
Whistling tunes of time's relentless attacks
Memories linger in every creak and groon
Of a place forgotten, yet not alone
