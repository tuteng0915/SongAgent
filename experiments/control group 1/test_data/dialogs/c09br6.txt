I want to create a high-energy rock song that's great for workouts. Can we start with a powerful guitar riff and a chant-like chorus?

Sure, let's create a high-energy rock song that will be perfect for workouts. We'll start with a powerful guitar riff and make the chorus chant-like to get the energy up. Let me set the tags and lyrics for this song.

I'll set the tags to reflect a high-energy rock style with elements that are great for workouts. For the lyrics, I'll write a verse that kicks off with a strong guitar riff and a chorus that has a chant-like quality.

It seems there was an error in setting the tags due to a formatting issue. Let me correct that and set the tags again for our high-energy rock song.

I'll make sure the tags reflect the energetic and workout-friendly nature of the song, with a focus on powerful guitar riffs and a chant-like chorus.
