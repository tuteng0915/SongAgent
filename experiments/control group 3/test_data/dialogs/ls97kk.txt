User : 
I want to create a song with electronic music and a female vocalist. The theme is about a mysterious presence in a mental hospital's radio, can you work with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can work with that concept. To make sure I understand your vision correctly, let's break it down:

1. **Genre & Style**: You're looking for electronic music with a female vocalist.
2. **Theme**: The song is about a mysterious presence in a mental hospital's radio.

Before we proceed to generate the lyrics and set the tags, do you have any specific preferences regarding the mood or particular elements you want to include? For example, should the song be more upbeat or have a darker tone considering the theme? And would you like any specific imagery or narrative included in the lyrics?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to create something that aligns well with your vision.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems like we might need a bit more detail from you. Since the theme is quite intriguing and somewhat eerie, I'm inclined to suggest a darker, more atmospheric tone for the song. However, it's important that this fits your vision.

Could you share if you prefer:
- A darker, mysterious atmosphere or something more uplifting?
- Any specific elements or imagery related to the mental hospital or the radio that you'd like woven into the lyrics?

With these details, I can tailor the song even more to your liking. Let me know what you think!
User : 
I think a darker vibe would fit well, and maybe include some references to the radio and the hospital. Just make it feel eerie but still danceable.

I've crafted some lyrics that aim to capture the eerie yet danceable vibe you're looking for, with references to the mysterious presence in the mental hospital's radio. Here's a preview of the sections:

```
[verse]
In the static of the night, whispers call
From the shadows of the ward, echoes fall
Voices lost in a spectral show
Dancing to the rhythm of an old radio

[chorus]
Tune in to the frequency of fear
Where spirits speak and haunt the air
Turn the dial, feel the chill so near
A presence lingers, you can't repair

[verse]
Behind these walls where secrets sleep
In the heart of darkness, silence keeps
Beneath the moon's cold, sterile glow
A mystery hums in the undertow

[chorus]
Tune in to the frequency of fear
Where spirits speak and haunt the air
Turn the dial, feel the chill so near
A presence lingers, you can't repair

[bridge]
The signal fades but never dies
Trapped between the living and lies
Electric dreams in limbo go
Haunting the halls through endless nights
```
