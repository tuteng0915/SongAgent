Lyrics :
[verse]
Life's a highway, I'm riding it all night long
Got the pedal to the metal, moving strong

[chorus]
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon in love
Feel the rhythm, let's groove from above

[bridge]
We can dance under the stars tonight
Let the music take us to new heights

[chorus]
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon in love
Feel the rhythm, let's groove from above
