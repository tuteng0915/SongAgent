I'm thinking of a mellow pop or R&B song, something that could be from the 90s to today. Can we start with that vibe?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's set the tags for a mellow pop/R&B song with a 90s to today vibe. I'll go ahead and set those parameters now.

Great! We've set the tags for a mellow pop or R&B song with a 90s to contemporary vibe. Now, let's work on some lyrics. Do you have any specific themes or topics in mind for the song? For example, love, nostalgia, heartbreak, or perhaps something more upbeat like celebration or empowerment?
User : 
The theme should be reflective, maybe about missing someone or something. Could we get a chorus that starts with "The one I'm missing is you"?
Agent : 
Certainly! We'll create a reflective theme around missing someone, with the chorus starting as you've suggested. Let's draft some initial lyrics for the song.

We've crafted some reflective lyrics with a chorus that starts with "The one I'm missing is you." Here's what we have so far:

```
[chorus]
The one I'm missing is you
In every moment, in all I do
I feel your absence anew
Wishing you were here, too

[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Memories linger where we used to meet
Every corner holds a trace of you
A silhouette against the sky so blue

[bridge]
Time moves on, but it doesn't heal
The void remains, an open seal
Hoping someday our paths will cross again
Until then, my heart won't settle or bend
```

When you're ready, press the "generate" button to manually generate the song. Let me know if there are any other changes or additions you'd like to make before then!
User : 
This is a good start, but can we add some backing vocals? Maybe soft harmonies or repeating "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" in the background during the chorus?

I've updated the tags to include backing vocals with soft harmonies and a "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" background during the chorus. 

Now that we have the tags and lyrics set, when you're ready, press the "generate" button to manually generate the song. Would you like to make any more adjustments before generating?
User : 
That sounds perfect. Can we also include an instrument like a xylophone or marimba for a unique touch?
Agent :

I've added the xylophone and marimba to our tags to give the song a unique instrumental touch. 

We're all set with the lyrics and updated tags for your reflective pop/R&B song. Go ahead and press the "generate" button whenever you're ready to create the song. If you think of anything else, feel free to let me know!
