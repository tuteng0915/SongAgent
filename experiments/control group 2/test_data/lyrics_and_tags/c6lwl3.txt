Lyrics :
[verse]
She takes his hand and leads the way,
Up the stairs where shadows play.
Whispers soft in the dim lit glow,
The weight of expectation starts to show.

[chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, but it feels so strange,
A bittersweet dance, a love that won't sustain.
The stories we heard, they painted skies,
But in the end, those dreams were all lies.

[verse]
Eyes search for meaning in the night,
In the silence, stars lose their light.
First times promised tales untold,
But reality's grasp is a story of old.

[chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, but it feels so strange,
A bittersweet dance, a love that won't sustain.
The stories we heard, they painted skies,
But in the end, those dreams were all lies.

[bridge]
Oh youth, with your promises wide,
How quickly you fade, how swiftly you hide.
In the echoes of laughter and tears we shed,
We find ourselves older, wiser instead.

[chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, memories align,
A fleeting moment, now lost in time.
The stories we lived, not the ones we'd find,
Are what truly matter, are etched in our minds.
