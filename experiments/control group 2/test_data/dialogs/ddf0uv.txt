Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that matches some specific vibes I have in mind. Here's what I'm thinking:  

- **Style**: A 60s-inspired sound with a raw, minimalist feel—no heavy background instrumentation like modern tracks.  
- **Vocals**: Either a female singer or a high-pitched male vocalist.  
- **Mood/Tone**: Cowboy-like, with a marching snare drum adding a rugged rhythm to the mix.  
- **Genre**: Not a ballad (definitely not "Ballad of the Green Berets"), but something more stripped-down and evocative.  

Think you can whip up something based on this? Let’s create it!

I've set up the song based on your preferences with tags like "60s, minimalist, raw, female vocals, high-pitched male vocals, cowboy, marching snare drum, stripped-down, evocative." The lyrics follow a theme that fits well within those vibes you're aiming for.

Here's a quick preview of the sections:

- **[verse]**: Riding through the canyon with the sun on my back...
- **[chorus]**: Oh, we're chasing horizons that never stand still...
- **[bridge]**: The snare drum beats like a second heartbeat...
- **[outro]**: So saddle up, partner, let's ride once more...
