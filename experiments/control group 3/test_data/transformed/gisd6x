Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on these ideas:

- There’s a band with multiple members, and they all work at a deli during the day.  
- But when night falls, they head to a secret club in the basement to perform.  
- The song features a female singer who sings a section of the track.  
- In the end, the club gets raided by the police, and it turns out that the female singer was an undercover cop all along.

Can you create something unique with these elements? Let’s see what you come up with!
