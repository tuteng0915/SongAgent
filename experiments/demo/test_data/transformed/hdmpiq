Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that matches some specific features. The song should have a highish-pitched vocal line with the lyrics "daaaaance, baby let's dance," followed by violins. It should be light and airy, reminiscent of an 80s sound but not limited to that decade. The style is group singing, somewhat similar to "Come on Eileen" by Dexys Midnight Runners. Can you help me create something like this?
