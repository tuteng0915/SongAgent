Lyrics :
[verse]
In the depths where shadows quiver,
I felt the pull of the river.
Velvet whispers in hues untold,
A canvas drowned in shades of old.

[chorus]
Falling down, lost in blue,
Where the cold waters pull me through.
Echoes call from caverns deep,
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.

[verse]
Strings like tears on a ghostly breeze,
Piano sighs amidst the trees.
Each note a ripple, each chord a wave,
In this somber tune, my heart's enslaved.

[chorus]
Falling down, lost in blue,
Where the cold waters pull me through.
Echoes call from caverns deep,
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.

[bridge]
Beneath the surface, time stands still,
A mournful hymn, a velvet will.
Creation born from sorrow's grasp,
Beauty and pain in every clasp.

[chorus]
Falling down, lost in blue,
Where the cold waters pull me through.
Echoes call from caverns deep,
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.
