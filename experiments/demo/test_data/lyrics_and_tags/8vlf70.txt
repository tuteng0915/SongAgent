Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding on the wings of a dream
Chasing shadows, racing streams
No boundaries, no holding back
Freedom's call, our only track

[chorus]
We're breaking free, flying high
Underneath the endless sky
With every heartbeat, feel alive
On this journey, we thrive

[verse]
Through the valleys and mountain highs
Beneath the stars, where adventure lies
Bold and fearless, we make our stand
In this wild land, hand in hand

[chorus]
We're breaking free, flying high
Underneath the endless sky
With every heartbeat, feel alive
On this journey, we thrive

[bridge]
Beyond the horizon, where dreams are born
Carry the fire, let passions sworn
Together we'll conquer, together we'll rise
In the dance of freedom, beneath the skies
