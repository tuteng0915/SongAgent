Lyrics :
[intro]
<|start_time|>Old man's voice:<|end_time|> "Back in the day, Coney Island was a magical place..."

[verse 1]
<|start_time|>waves gently crashing on the shore<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>the scent of saltwater fills the air<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>echoes of laughter and screams from the rides<|end_time|>

[chorus]
<|start_time|>oh, those nostalgic memories<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>of cotton candy skies and carousel dreams<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>time stands still at Coney Island<|end_time|>

[verse 2]
<|start_time|>the old man pauses, lost in thought<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>his eyes glistening with bittersweet tears<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>as he recalls the golden summers of his youth<|end_time|>

[chorus]
<|start_time|>oh, those nostalgic memories<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>of cotton candy skies and carousel dreams<|end_time|>
<|start_time|>time stands still at Coney Island<|end_time|>

[outro]
<|start_time|>Old man's voice fading out:<|end_time|> "...and I'll never forget the joy it brought to my heart."
