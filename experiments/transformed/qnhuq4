Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches a specific vibe I've been obsessing over. The song should have a fast-paced, metal-inspired sound with a catchy, rhythmic hook similar to the "Bawitdaba, da bang, da dang diggy diggy, diggy" part from Kid Rock's *Bawitdaba*. However, instead of rap-rock, this one needs to lean heavily into a heavier, more aggressive metal style. The singerâ€™s voice should be raspy and intense, adding to the raw energy of the track. Think high-octane instrumentation with pounding drums, shredding guitars, and an overall gritty feel. Can you create something like that for me?
