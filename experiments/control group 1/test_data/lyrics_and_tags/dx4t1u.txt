Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up in a cold sweat again
The taste of metal on my lips
I can feel it calling from within
A shadowed world where my spirit dips

[chorus]
Heroin, you pull me under
A tide of needles and despair
In your arms, I lose myself
Sinking deeper, unaware

[verse]
Fading echoes whisper my name
Chasing highs that never last
Through the haze, I'm still the same
Bound by chains of a toxic past

[chorus]
Heroin, you pull me under
A tide of needles and despair
In your arms, I lose myself
Sinking deeper, unaware

[bridge]
But I'll rise above this endless fight
Find a way to let the light back in
Break these chains, reclaim my life
Turn the page and start again

[chorus]
Heroin, no more pulling under
I see now through the despair
From your grasp, I've found myself
Climbing higher, bold and aware
