Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits the following description: The song should have a rock vibe with a dubstep-inspired guitar effect in the chorus, particularly a "wub wub" sound, though it shouldn’t fully lean into being a dubstep track. It should feel like it could’ve been released around 2012 when dubstep was fading but still influential. The rhythm of the guitar should follow a syncopated pattern like: 1 a + 3 a + 1, giving it a faux-triplet feel. The lyrics and energy should evoke the feeling of breaking free or liberation, as if the walls are metaphorically (or literally) coming down during the chorus. The overall tone should be radio-friendly, catchy, and fit well on rock radio stations from that era. Let’s create something that captures this vibe!

### Lyrics
```
[verse]
I've been waiting for the moment to arise
Trapped inside these walls, can't see the skies
But now I hear it calling, feel the fire ignite
Time to break out, let the spirit take its flight

[chorus]
Walls are crashing down, hear the sound explode
Dubstep in my veins, rock and roll unloads
Feel the thunder shake, as we rise above
Breaking every chain, this is boundless love

[verse]
Every heartbeat pounds like a drum in my chest
Syncopated rhythms won't let me suppress
The power that's been building up inside
Now's the time to run, no need to hide

[bridge]
The echoes of the past can't hold us anymore
We'll tear through the night, unlock every door
Freedom's in our grasp, nothing left to lose
Let the music guide us, let the groove seduce

[chorus]
Walls are crashing down, hear the sound explode
Dubstep in my veins, rock and roll unloads
Feel the thunder shake, as we rise above
Breaking every chain, this is boundless love
