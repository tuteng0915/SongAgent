Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. I want it to have a late 80s to early 90s rock feel, but not the arena or hair band styleâ€”more of a classic American rock sound with a slightly poppy twist. The key feature of the song is a breakdown section where the word "baby" is repeated over and over in a rising and falling scale. It would be great if the scale goes through a couple of times and possibly ends with the word "right." Can you help me craft something like that?
