I'd love a song that's upbeat and poppy, kind of like the pre-2012 tracks. Can you whip something up?

Sure thing! To make sure I hit the right notes, could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for? Any specific themes or lyrics you'd like included? Or any particular artist or style from that era you're fond of?
User : 
Something quirky and funny would be great, and it should be by a Black female artist from back in the day. How about a song about the apocalypse?

Alright, I've got a quirky and funny upbeat pop song about the apocalypse, inspired by the style of a Black female artist from before 2012. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
When the sky turns green and the oceans glow
It's the end of the world, don't you know?
Grab my hand and we'll dance in the street
To the funky beat, it's our last retreat

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[verse]
We'll paint the town with neon dreams
While the world ends in fiery beams
From the ashes rises a disco ball
In this crazy chaos, we'll have a ball

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[bridge]
Oh, the comet's a-calling, but we won't despair
With afros and platforms, we've got flair to spare
Glitter in our hair, stars in our eyes
In this wild ride, we're gonna improvise

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

That sounds fun! But can we add some zombies in the backyard going nuts? And maybe a funny robot voice at the end?

I've added zombies in the backyard going nuts and a funny robot voice at the end. Here's the updated version:

[verse]
When the sky turns green and the oceans glow
It's the end of the world, don't you know?
Grab my hand and we'll dance in the street
To the funky beat, it's our last retreat

In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

We'll paint the town with neon dreams
While the world ends in fiery beams
From the ashes rises a disco ball
In this crazy chaos, we'll have a ball

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[verse]
Zombies in the backyard going absolutely nuts
Doing the twist and shouting out "What's up?"
Funny robot voice joins in at the end
Saying "System update required, my friend"

[outro]
So we dance on, as the world unwinds
With good vibes only, and open minds
Together we'll face whatever may come
In this apocalypse party, we're second to none

Now go ahead and press the "generate" button to create the song with these new additions!

The robot voice is hilarious, but can it say something even more random? Like, "Oh, you had triplets instead of twins? Your pork tastes like chicken?"
