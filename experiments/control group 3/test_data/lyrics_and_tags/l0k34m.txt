Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night, we stand side by side
With a common purpose, our spirits collide
Through the highs and the lows, we keep pushing through
For every challenge, there's a dream anew

[chorus]
United we rise, with one voice we sing
Together we soar, on hope's mighty wings
Hand in hand, we'll never let go
With unity's light, we'll forever glow

[verse]
From different paths, we find our way
Building bridges that lead to brighter days
With every heartbeat, we march along
Creating a symphony, a world so strong

[chorus]
United we rise, with one voice we sing
Together we soar, on hope's mighty wings
Hand in hand, we'll never let go
With unity's light, we'll forever glow

[bridge]
Oh, when shadows fall, and hope seems far
Remember the power within each star
Together we shine, brighter than ever before
Our unity unites us, opening every door

[chorus]
United we rise, with one voice we sing
Together we soar, on hope's mighty wings
Hand in hand, we'll never let go
With unity's light, we'll forever glow
