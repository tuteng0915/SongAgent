[verse]
Neon lights they flicker bright
City hums in dead of night
Rhythms pulse through concrete veins
Lost in echoes of refrains

[verse]
Bassline groovin' in my chest
Heartbeats match the city's zest
Electric whispers fill the air
Synthesized dreams everywhere

[chorus]
Turn it up and let it flow
Feel the fire let it grow
In this rhythm we belong
Hear the night sing out our song

[verse]
Guitar strings they start to weep
Wake the soul from silent sleep
Every note a story told
In this night weâ€™re bold and gold

[bridge]
Voices blend in harmony
Lost in pure cacophony
Timeless echoes timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[verse]
Keyboard dances on the keys
Melodies on evening breeze
Catch the tune and hold it tight
In this moment we take flight
