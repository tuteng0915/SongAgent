Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up late again, sun's shining bright
Another day, just killin' time tonight
I'm the king of my world, though it's kinda small
Got no plans, but I'll take on all

[chorus]
Slacker superstar, living in my head
Dreaming 'bout the life, where I always get ahead
Though I might not shine, I'm still the main act
In this one-horse town, I'm the hero in fact

[verse]
Chillin' with my friends, we don't need no scene
Just some chips and dips, we're livin' the dream
The future's wide open, or so we say
Tomorrow's just another day to play

[chorus]
Slacker superstar, living in my head
Dreaming 'bout the life, where I always get ahead
Though I might not shine, I'm still the main act
In this one-horse town, I'm the hero in fact

[bridge]
We laugh at the world, from our couches we peek
At the lives we could lead, if we weren't so meek
But heroes come in many forms, you see
And mine's as good as theirs can be

[chorus]
Slacker superstar, living in my head
Dreaming 'bout the life, where I always get ahead
Though I might not shine, I'm still the main act
In this one-horse town, I'm the hero in fact

[outro]
So here's to the slackers, the dreamers, the lost
To each their own crown, no matter the cost
For in our own stories, we all play a part
Even us slackers, with our big-hearted hearts
