Lyrics :
[verse]
We've come to an end,
A silent goodbye we never mend.
I hold onto dreams of you and me,
But they're fading away like the autumn leaves.

[chorus]
Why does love have to hurt so much?
When it's over, it takes a piece of us.
I'm lost in this sorrowful symphony,
Hoping one day I'll be free.

[verse]
Our memories linger in every corner,
Every smile and tear a part of my armor.
I walk these lonely streets at night,
Wishing stars could bring back what felt so right.

[chorus]
Why does love have to hurt so much?
When it's over, it takes a piece of us.
I'm lost in this sorrowful symphony,
Hoping one day I'll be free.

[bridge]
The pain will fade, or so they say,
But how do I move on when all I want is yesterday?
Every heartbeat echoes your name,
In this quiet storm, I'm not the same.

[chorus]
Why does love have to hurt so much?
When it's over, it takes a piece of us.
I'm lost in this sorrowful symphony,
Hoping one day I'll be free.

[ending]
Goodbye, my love, I release you now,
Though letting go feels like breaking vows.
May you find peace, may I find strength,
To heal this heart and go the length.
