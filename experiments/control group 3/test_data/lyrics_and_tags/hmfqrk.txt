Lyrics :
[Verse]
Racing through the city streets, shadows leap and bound,
Parkour in the moonlight, feet don't touch the ground.
Buildings turn to playgrounds, every wall a friend,
In this urban jungle, the chase will never end.

[Chorus]
Move it like a movie scene, action-packed and wild,
Feel the rush of freedom, dance to chaos styled.
Jumping, flipping, defying gravity's decree,
British beats with funky bass, set your spirit free.

[Bridge]
Heart is pounding faster, adrenaline's embrace,
Every twist and turn reveals another race.
With a voice that's got that accent, London's on my mind,
Energy unbridled, let our spirits intertwine.
