Lyrics :
[verse]
Cruising down the highway with the sun on our face,
Windows down, music loud, living life without a trace.
Every stop's a new story, every mile's a new song,
We're chasing the horizon, where we belong.

[chorus]
Oh, summer nights, endless skies,
With you by my side, we'll never compromise.
Feel the breeze, taste the waves,
In this fleeting moment, we find our escape.

[verse]
The ocean calls, its rhythm in our veins,
Saltwater dreams and the thrill of no chains.
From sunrise to sunset, we dance in the tide,
Living for the adventure, with nothing to hide.

[chorus]
Oh, summer nights, endless skies,
With you by my side, we'll never compromise.
Feel the breeze, taste the waves,
In this fleeting moment, we find our escape.

[bridge]
Time slows down, the world fades away,
Just the sound of laughter and the sea's ballet.
Heartbeats sync, under starlit skies,
This is our moment, where forever lies.

[chorus]
Oh, summer nights, endless skies,
With you by my side, we'll never compromise.
Feel the breeze, taste the waves,
In this fleeting moment, we find our escape.
