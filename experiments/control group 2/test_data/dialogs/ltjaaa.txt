Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song based on some details I remember from my childhood. The song is about a mother who faces hardships but keeps persevering, finding small treasures like gems or grain for her daughter while walking along the roadside. There might be a line about painful shoes, though I’m not entirely sure. It was performed by a popular female artist and accompanied primarily by a violin. Can you create something in that vein? I’d love it to capture the same emotional depth and beauty of the original memory I have.

[verse]
Walking down the old road,
With worn-out shoes that hurt so,
Every step a silent ode,
To treasures found amidst the dirt and flaws.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your strength never fades,
Through every storm, through every shade,
Finding gems where no one dares to look,
A testament to love, in the stories that you took.

[verse]
In the whispers of the wind,
I hear your gentle voice again,
Guiding me through paths untold,
With lessons stitched in threads of gold.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your strength never fades,
Through every storm, through every shade,
Finding gems where no one dares to look,
A testament to love, in the stories that you took.

[bridge]
The world may be cruel, unforgiving and vast,
But within your arms, I was always home at last,
Though the journey was tough, and the nights were long,
In your eyes, I saw where I truly belong.
