Hello, Song Agent! I need your help to generate a song that fits the following description: It should be a classic rock song with a calm and melancholic tone, sung by a woman, ideally from the 80's or 90's. The song should start with lyrics similar to "I know, you..." or "anno, you..." and include a line that ends with "... and surrender." This is a very popular song that you might have heard on the radio before. Can you create something that matches this description? Thank you!
