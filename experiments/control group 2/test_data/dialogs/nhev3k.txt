Hey there! I need you to generate a song for me. Here's what I'm looking for:  

It should be a popular dance/party song from the last couple of years, with a catchy EDM vibe. Thereâ€™s a part where a female voice says "dance dance dance" right before the beat drops, and then it continues faintly in the background after the drop. Itâ€™s super energetic and perfect for getting people moving on the dance floor.  

Can you create something like that?

Alright, I've set everything up for your song! Here's a quick preview of what to expect:

- **Lyrics Structure**:  
  - *[Intro]*: A quiet female vocal chop repeats "dance... dance... dance..." before the beat drops.  
  - *[Verse 1 & 2]*: Catchy lines about energy and movement on the dance floor.  
  - *[Pre-Chorus]*: Builds anticipation with rhythmic phrasing.  
  - *[Chorus]*: Repeats an infectious hookâ€”"Dance, dance, dance, donâ€™t stop the motion"â€”with high-energy vibes.
