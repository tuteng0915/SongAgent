Lyrics :
[verse]
I feel the wind in my hair,
Sunset skies painted with care.
The waves roll by like a lullaby,
And I dream of days gone by.

[chorus]
Oh, ocean blue, I'm lost in you,
The rhythm of time feels so new.
Every moment fades too soon,
Underneath the pale moon.

[verse]
Walking down this sandy trail,
Memories echo, soft and frail.
Summer nights and firefly lights,
We danced beneath those starry skies.

[chorus]
Oh, ocean blue, I'm lost in you,
The rhythm of time feels so new.
Every moment fades too soon,
Underneath the pale moon.

[bridge]
Time may pass, seasons will change,
But your laughter still sounds strange.
In every wave, I hear your name,
Calling me back just the same.

[chorus]
Oh, ocean blue, I'm lost in you,
The rhythm of time feels so new.
Every moment fades too soon,
Underneath the pale moon.

[outro]
Iâ€™m still in love with youuuuu...
