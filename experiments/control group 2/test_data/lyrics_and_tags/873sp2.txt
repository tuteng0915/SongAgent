Lyrics :
[verse]
In a room painted gray with despair,
A cheerleader blonde, lost in the air.
Her pom-poms down, her spirit worn,
Amongst the echoes, she's all alone.

[chorus]
C-B-A, counting sins, not a friend to call my own,
C-B-A, chasing shadows, in this world of stone.

[verse]
She swallows pills, to ease her mind,
But memories flood, too hard to find.
The rhythm of drums, a march so cold,
In this endless night, she's growing old.

[bridge]
Oh, the taste of dreams that never were,
The cheer of crowds, now just a blur.
With every spell, her heart does churn,
In this alphabet of woe, there's much to learn.

[chorus]
C-B-A, a map of sorrow, where shadows play,
C-B-A, in the silence, dreams decay.
