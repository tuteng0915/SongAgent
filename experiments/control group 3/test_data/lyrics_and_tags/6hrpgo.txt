Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the night alone
City lights reflect my zone

[chorus]
I'm chasing dreams on my own
Every heartbeat fuels the stone
In the silence, I've grown

[bridge]
Voices echo, faces blur
Journey long, but I endure

[chorus]
I'm chasing dreams on my own
Every heartbeat fuels the stone
In the silence, I've grown
