Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the unknown,
A heart beats strong, alone.
Facing storms with steadfast pace,
Carving courage through the pain.

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky,
Dreams unbroken, spirits high.
Through the fire, we'll never fade,
With every step, our fears betrayed.

[verse]
Mountains crumble, rivers dry,
Yet hope endures where dreams comply.
With each dawn, a chance anew,
To face the world with strength and truth.

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky,
Dreams unbroken, spirits high.
Through the fire, we'll never fade,
With every step, our fears betrayed.

[bridge]
In the quiet, find your voice,
A single tear, a world of choice.
Hold on tight to love and grace,
Feel the warmth, find your place.
