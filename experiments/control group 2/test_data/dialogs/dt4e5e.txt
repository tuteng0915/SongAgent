Hello, song generating agent! I have a very specific song in mind that I'd love for you to create. Here are the details:

I'm looking for a super sad and haunting song with a strong visual component in the lyrics. The imagery should evoke an old barn or house that's falling apart, with a rocking chair, all presented in a black and white, sepia, or faded color palette. Think glitchy, crackly, 16mm or super 8 camera aesthetic.

The song should feature a male and female vocalist singing to each other. The male part should talk about the house, while the female part responds, suggesting there's nothing left for the guy in the house anymore. The theme can be open to interpretation, but it could hint at something tragic like an abortion or a fire.

Musically, it should be really folksy, similar to early Angus & Julia Stone, with a slow and whispery delivery. If possible, try to incorporate the word "Trees" into the title, as it might resonate with the theme or vibe of the song.

Can you generate a song based on these requirements?

I've crafted a song that matches your detailed vision. Here's a summary of what I've done:

- **Tags**: I've included descriptors such as "sad," "haunting," "old barn/house," "falling apart," "rocking chair," and visual aesthetics like "black and white," "sepia," and "faded." Musical style pointers like "folksy," "slow," "whispery," and "Angus & Julia Stone" are also present. Additional thematic elements suggested by you include "tragic," "abortion," "fire," and the inclusion of "Trees."

- **Lyrics**: The lyrics feature a male and female vocalist singing to each other. The male verses talk about the house filled with imagery of decay, while the female choruses suggest there's nothing left for him in this place of despair. The theme of tragedy is subtly hinted at with mentions of ashes and lost dreams. The word "Trees" has been incorporated into the title and throughout the song to resonate with the overall vibe.
