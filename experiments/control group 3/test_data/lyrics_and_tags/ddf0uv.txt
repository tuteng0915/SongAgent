Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadowed streets we roam,
Whispers of change in every home,
The times they are a-changin' fast,
We're breaking free from the chains of the past.

[chorus]
Oh, we'll sing out loud, our voices clear,
Against the tide, we have no fear,
With hearts unbound, we pave the way,
For a brighter dawn, a brand new day.

[verse]
Signs of protest line the square,
Echoes of hope fill the air,
Unyielding spirits, young and bold,
A story of rebellion, forever told.

[bridge]
Hand in hand, we stand tall tonight,
Our dreams will guide us towards the light,
No longer silent, we make our stand,
In the pages of history, we leave our mark.
