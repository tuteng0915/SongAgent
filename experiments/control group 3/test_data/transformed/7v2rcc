Hey there! I'm looking to generate a high-tempo, pop-punk style song that captures the essence of bands like The Ataris. Here's what I'm thinking:

- **Style & Tempo:** High energy, pop-punk vibe.
- **Chorus:** Something along the lines of "everything will be alright alright."
- **Intro:** Starting with lyrics like "go and leave me."
- **Vocalist:** Younger male singer, probably in his 20s.
- **Era:** Has that late '90s to early 2000s feel.

Can you help me create a song with these elements? Let's rock it! ðŸŽ¸
