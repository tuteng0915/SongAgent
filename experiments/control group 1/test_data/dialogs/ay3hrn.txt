I'm excited to help you create this song! Let's start by focusing on the verses. Could you describe the theme or story you'd like the verses to tell?

Sure! To better understand your vision, could you please specify the theme or story you want the verses to convey? For instance, are we exploring themes of love, adventure, introspection, or something else? Additionally, any specific imagery or emotions you'd like to include would be helpful. Once I have a clearer picture, I can craft verses that align with your ideas.
