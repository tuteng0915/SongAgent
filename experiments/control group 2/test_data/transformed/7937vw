Hey, song agent! I need you to generate a melancholy song that fits this vibe: it's like something out of those nineties movies where a character realizes they've made a terrible mistake. The singer should draw out the word "change" in a way that almost sounds like "chains," emphasizing the H sound when singing "Cha Ha Change." Itâ€™s moody, reflective, and full of regret. Can you create something with that atmosphere?
