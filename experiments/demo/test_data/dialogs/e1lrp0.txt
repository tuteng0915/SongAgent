I need a song that's kind of spooky and fast-paced, with a band playing. And it's about this guy who didn't mean to fall for this woman... can you start working on that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can start working on that. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me a bit more about the mood you're aiming for? Should it be more mysterious or thrilling? And do you have any preferences for the type of band (e.g., rock, jazz, classical)?

Also, could you provide some more details about the story or feelings you want to convey in the lyrics? That way, I can tailor them more closely to your vision.

Once I have these details, I'll generate the tags and lyrics for your song.

Thanks for confirming that. Let's go ahead and create a spooky, fast-paced song with a band arrangement, focusing on the theme of unintended love. Given the details you've provided, I will aim for a thrilling and mysterious mood with a rock band setup.

Let's proceed to generate the initial tags and lyrics for the song. After we have these, you can review them and make any necessary adjustments before generating the song.

I'll start by setting the tags and creating the lyrics.

```
[verse]
In shadows deep, where whispers call,
A fleeting glimpse, she steals it all.
No compass points to where I stand,
Her eyes like stars in shifting sand.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.

[verse]
Footsteps echo down deserted streets,
Our rhythm syncs with every heartbeat.
Moonlight dances on her silhouette,
In this ghostly waltz, there's no regret.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.

[bridge]
Haunted nights, our spirits entwine,
Invisible threads, a bond undefined.
Through misty veils, our futures blend,
An unforeseen path, where shadows bend.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.
```

The lyrics and tags look great, but can we make sure the keyboard sound is really haunting, like a theramin? That's key for the vibe I'm after.
