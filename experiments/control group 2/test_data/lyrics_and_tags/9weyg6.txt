Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of drums
Marching off to fight in foreign lands
Dark skies above, heavy heart below
I'm a soldier ready for the blow

[chorus]
Feel like a cannonball sinking in my chest
Fighting wars that I don't understand
In a land far from home, where peace is just a guest
With every step forward, I'm losing who I am

[verse]
Bullets fly and comrades fall
Echoes of the silenced calls
Amidst the chaos, I've lost my way
Dreams of yesterday are fading away

[chorus]
Feel like a cannonball sinking in my chest
Fighting wars that I don't understand
In a land far from home, where peace is just a guest
With every step forward, I'm losing who I am

[bridge]
The moody colors paint our fate
Shadows long in the desert's state
What we seek is not what we find
In the battlefield, peace of mind

[chorus]
Feel like a cannonball sinking in my chest
Fighting wars that I don't understand
In a land far from home, where peace is just a guest
With every step forward, I'm losing who I am

[outro]
As I march back home, will I be the same?
Or just another soul, lost in the game?
