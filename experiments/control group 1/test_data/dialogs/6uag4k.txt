User : 
I want a song that has a strong, rhythmic beat, almost like machinery in motion. Can we start with that?

Sure, let's create a song with a strong, rhythmic beat that emulates machinery in motion. I will set the tags to reflect this style.

I'll go ahead and set the initial tags for the song.


Successfully set the parameter tags
I have set the tags for the song to "industrial, mechanical, rhythmic, strong beat, electronic" to capture that feeling of machinery in motion with a strong, rhythmic beat. 

Since we're starting from scratch, here's a basic structure for our song:

[Verse]
Pistons pumping, relentless drive,
Gears are turning, they come alive,
In the heart of steel and smoke,
Every rhythm, a heartbeat spoke.

[Chorus]
Feel the clanging, the unyielding sound,
Rhythms pounding, like the world's bound,
Mechanical dance, under twilight's glow,
This is the pulse, of the machine show.
