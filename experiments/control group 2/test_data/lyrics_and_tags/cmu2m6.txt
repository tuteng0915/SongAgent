Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to see my girl wasn't there
Found a note that read "Your friend's got flair"
Neighbor's house lit up like the Fourth of July
But I'm just standing here with watering can in my hand

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[verse]
Took a sledgehammer to the kitchen wall
Paintings fell down like a comedy show
This heartbreak ain’t so bad after all
'Cause now I've got a story no one will forget

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[bridge]
Oh, who needs love when you’ve got tools?
Pots and pans make better fools
So grab your hammer, feel alive
Break some walls, let’s survive!

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[outro]
By tomorrow night, I'll build a bar
Out of pieces of our old love car
Life's too short for being blue
So here's to revenge—and plants too!
