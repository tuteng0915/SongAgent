Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that captures the essence of an older g-funk/rap/hip-hop track from the 90s or later, something with vibes similar to “Forgot About Dre.” The beat should have that classic West Coast bounce—smooth, funky, and heavy on the synth basslines, with some crisp hi-hats and maybe even a sample or two for nostalgia.

For the chorus, I envision a female vocalist delivering something catchy and soulful, almost like a hook you can’t get out of your head. It could be along the lines of "It's the boogie woogie yeahhh" or "It's the something of them aaaallll," but feel free to interpret it however fits best musically. Think big, bold, and anthemic—a moment where the energy just explodes.

This needs to slap hard, so let’s make sure it’s got that larger-than-life vibe throughout. Let me know if you need more details, but otherwise, let’s create this banger!

**Tags:** g-funk, 90s hip-hop, west coast rap, smooth, funky, synth bass, crisp hi-hats, nostalgia, soulful chorus, anthemic, female vocals, boogie, hook, energetic, vibrant  

**Lyrics:**

[verse]
Rollin' down the street in that low-low jeep,
Bass knockin' hard, got the whole block on repeat.
Smell the chronic, it's the scent of success,
West Coast vibes, yeah, we do it the best.

[chorus]
It's the boogie woogie yeahhh (yeahhh)
Feel the rhythm and the flow don't stop (don't stop)
It's the essence of them aaaallll (aaaallll)
When the beat drops, everybody on call.

[verse 2]
Synth lines sliding like a snake in the grass,
High hats snapping, time to crank up the bass.
Forgot about the stress, just ride with me,
This is more than music, it's a legacy.

[bridge]
From Compton streets to the world we rise,
Under neon lights and Cali skies.
This ain't just a song, it's a vibe, an era,
Feel the funk and let it carry you nearer.

[chorus]
It's the boogie woogie yeahhh (yeahhh)
Feel the rhythm and the flow don't stop (don't stop)
It's the essence of them aaaallll (aaaallll)
When the beat drops, everybody on call.
