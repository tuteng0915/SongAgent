Hello, song generating agent! Based on the details provided, I would like you to generate a soft rock song from the 2000s that tells a love story. The song should be divided into three parts, each representing a different stage in the girl's life: her youth, her late teens/early adulthood, and her as a grown-up.

The final scene should evoke imagery of her walking down a beach, dressed in white, with the camera zooming in on her face. The overall tone should be romantic and reminiscent, capturing the essence of a love that has grown over time.

Please include tags that reflect the style and themes of the song, such as "soft rock," "love story," "romantic," "nostalgic," and any others you feel are fitting. 

Thank you! Let's create this song together.
