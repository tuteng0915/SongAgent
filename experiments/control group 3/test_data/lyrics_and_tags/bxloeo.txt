Lyrics :
[Verse]
Lights are shining bright tonight
We're dancing under neon skies
The city's heartbeat, it's our guide
In this moment, we come alive

[Chorus]
Celebrate the night away
Underneath the disco sway
With friends by my side
We'll dance till sunrise

[Bridge]
Feel the rhythm, hear the sound
Lost in the music, we spin around
Every beat lifts us higher
Fueling our fire

[Chorus]
Celebrate the night away
Underneath the disco sway
With friends by my side
We'll dance till sunrise
