Lyrics :
[intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[verse 1 - Female]
Walking down these city streets
Feeling the pulse, feeling the beat
They told me to conform, to play it safe and sound
But I'm breaking out, I won't be bound

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is my time, my revolution's here

[verse 2 - Female]
Painting the town in colors so bright
Dancing through the night, under neon lights
Their rules don't define me, I write my own page
In this world of dreams, I'm setting the stage

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is my time, my revolution's here

[bridge - Female]
Every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm carving paths no one else will make
Together we rise, together we'll fall
We're the dreamers, answering the call

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is our time, our revolution's here

[outro - Female]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
