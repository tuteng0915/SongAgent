I'm excited to help you create this unique song! Let's start by focusing on the core elements. Could you share a simple idea or feeling that you'd like the chorus of the song to convey?
Agent : 
Sure! To start off, could you tell me what kind of themes or emotions you'd like the chorus to express? For example, it could be about love, freedom, joy, or even something more specific like the excitement of embarking on a new adventure. Once I have a sense of that, I can craft a chorus that captures the essence of your idea. 

To give you an example, if you wanted the chorus to express **freedom**, it might sound something like this:

**[chorus]**  
We’re chasing skies that never end,  
Heartbeats soaring, round the bend,  
No chains to hold us down tonight,  
In this moment, we take our flight.

So, let me know—what feeling or theme should we focus on for your song's chorus?
