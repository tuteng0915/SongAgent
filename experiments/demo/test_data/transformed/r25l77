Hello, Song Agent! I need your help to generate a song that fits the following criteria:  

- Genre: Pop/Rock, with a style reminiscent of artists like Decade and Don Broco.  
- Key Themes: The song should include the words "America" and "foreign land," ideally repeated in the chorus or at significant points in the song.  

Can you craft something that matches this description? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
