Lyrics :
[verse]
Screaming at the top of your lungs
In the darkness, where no one sees
You're fighting for something you believe in
Came to some kind of fight

[chorus]
Do what you want, do what you want
Feel the power, let it out
Do what you want, do what you want
Hear the thunder, scream and shout

[verse]
Breaking free from all the chains
Living life on your own terms
No more rules, no more restraints
Came to some kind of fight

[chorus]
Do what you want, do what you want
Feel the power, let it out
Do what you want, do what you want
Hear the thunder, scream and shout

[bridge]
We'll rise above, we'll never fall
Our voices strong, we'll give it our all
Together we'll conquer, together we'll win
Came to some kind of fight, let the battle begin

[chorus]
Do what you want, do what you want
Feel the power, let it out
Do what you want, do what you want
Hear the thunder, scream and shout

[outro]
Screaming at the top of your lungs
Do what you want, do what you want
