Lyrics :
[verse]
In his bathrobe, he's a sight to see
With flowers in hand, he's smashing free

[chorus]
Stay cool, stay funny, even when you're on a spree
Destroying stuff with a smile so cheeky
Bathrobe warrior, that's who he wants to be

[verse]
Amongst the ruins, petals fall
A light-hearted joke, he's got it all
