Lyrics :
[verse]
She left a note by the door
With her dreams packed tight in a pickup truck
No goodbye, just the open road and the promise of luck

[chorus]
Chasing stars in the rearview mirror
Leaving dust on the country border
Every mile a memory, every song a starter
On this road to who she is meant to be

[verse]
Years flew by with the city lights
Shining bright as she danced through the crowd
Her name in neon, but her heart stayed down home proud

[bridge]
Through the tears, through the fame
Still she hears that old train call her name
Back to where it all began, to faces that remain the same

[chorus]
Now she's got stars in her eyes looking back
To the love that never once lost track
Of the girl who left but never really went astray
Coming home, like a long-forgotten melody

[ending]
They hug her tight under southern skies
A perfect end where true love lies
