Lyrics :
[verse]
Remember the days when skies were wide,
Chasing the sun as it slipped and hide,
Barefoot races on golden sands,
We ruled the world with pocketful plans.

[chorus]
Oh, those endless summers, they never fade,
Underneath the stars, where dreams cascade,
Every heartbeat echoes through time,
In this journey of ours, life's sweetest rhyme.

[verse]
Neon lights and open highways,
Singing loud to our favorite playlists,
Windows down, wind in our hair,
Freedomâ€™s song, we had no cares.

[chorus]
Oh, those endless summers, they never fade,
Underneath the stars, where dreams cascade,
Every heartbeat echoes through time,
In this journey of ours, life's sweetest rhyme.

[bridge]
Through every twist and turn, we found our way,
Laughing louder with each brand new day,
Memories stitched in colors so bright,
Our story unfolds under moonlit nights.
