User : 
I'd love to create a song based on your story! To start, could you tell me more about the emotions you want to highlight in the lyrics?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To create a song that truly resonates with your experiences, could you share some specific moments or feelings you'd like to express? For instance, do you want the lyrics to focus on themes of love, adventure, nostalgia, or perhaps something entirely different? Additionally, if you have any preferences for the music style (like pop, rock, classical, etc.), please let me know as well. This will help me tailor both the lyrics and the overall vibe of the song to better match your vision.
User : 
I think capturing the emotions of determination and solitude would be great. The music style should be something modern, like pop or EDM. How does that sound?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
That sounds wonderful. To ensure the song captures determination and solitude with a modern pop or EDM style, I will go ahead and draft some initial lyrics and set appropriate tags.

Let's proceed to generate the song components.

[verse]
Walking through the night alone
City lights reflect my zone

Every heartbeat fuels the stone
In the silence, I've grown

Voices echo, faces blur
Journey long, but I endure
