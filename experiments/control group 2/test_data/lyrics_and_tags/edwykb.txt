Lyrics :
[intro]
[arpeggio]
[verse]
Chords and drums together we go
Feeling the rhythm start to flow
[chorus]
Back to the arpeggio we fly
Music taking us through the sky
[bridge]
Let the beat drop, let it all fade
Feel the energy that we've made
[chorus]
Back to the arpeggio we soar
Lifting our spirits evermore
[outro]
[arpeggio]
