Hey there! I'd like you to generate a slow, mellow breakup song for me. The theme should revolve around the girlfriend leaving one day, capturing all those raw emotions of heartbreak and longing. Oh, and towards the end, can we include a poignant twist with a line like: "I thought I saw you the other day, dad!" Let's make it resonate deeply with listeners who've experienced loss and reflection. Looking forward to what you come up with!

I've crafted a slow, mellow breakup song that delves into the emotions of heartbreak and longing, with a poignant twist towards the end. Here's a snippet of what we've created:

```
[verse]
I woke up today, you were gone
Just like that, our love withdrawn
The silence screams, it cuts so deep
In this cold bed, where dreams sleep

...

[twist]
I thought I saw you the other day, dad
In the crowd, just a fleeting glance
But it wasn't you, just another man
Yet in that moment, I understood
```
