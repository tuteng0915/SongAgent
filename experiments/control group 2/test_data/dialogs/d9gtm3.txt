Hey there! I've got this song idea that's been floating around in my head, and I'd love for you to help me generate it. Here’s what I’m thinking:

- The song should have a synth intro that sets the tune.
- It should include lyrics with the phrases "I know you’re a dreamer" and "Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to lose."
- After the line "nothing left to lose," there should be a little guitar riff, followed by a rhyming line.
- The style should feel like it could be from a British band, with a definite singer-songwriter vibe.

Can you help me create a song based on these elements? Cheers!

I have generated a song based on your ideas. The tags set for the song are "synth intro, British band, singer-songwriter, dreamy, reflective," which should reflect the style you're looking for.

Here are the lyrics I've put together:

```
[verse]
I know you’re a dreamer
Lost in your world of make-believe
Floating on clouds, so high above
Where the air is thin and love's unseen

[chorus]
Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to lose
A guitar riff takes you away
To find the truth in what you choose
With a heart that’s brave, there’s no delay

[bridge]
In the silence, hear your soul
Whispering secrets, making whole
The pieces of a broken muse
Find your path, there’s no excuse

[chorus]
Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to fear
A melody that’s crystal clear
Guides you forward, break the fuse
With a newfound vision, pave the way, don’t lose
```
