Lyrics :
[verse]
I walk in, lights flash, but I'm out of sync
Heads turn, but I feel like I'm on the brink

[chorus]
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?

[verse]
Neon signs blur, shadows whisper my name
The beat is electric, but it feels so tame

[chorus]
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?

[bridge]
Maybe someday, I'll find my place
But tonight, I'm just a ghost in this space

[chorus]
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?
