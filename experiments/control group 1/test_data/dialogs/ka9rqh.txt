User : 
I'm looking for a country song with a cowboy theme. It should have a bit of a sad ending. Can you work with that?

I've crafted a country song with a cowboy theme just for you. It tells the tale of a lone cowboy riding through vast plains, reflecting on lost love and dreams under the stars. The song ends on a melancholic note as our cowboy rides off into the sunrise, carrying the weight of his memories.

Here are the sections I've created:

- **[verse]**: Sets the scene with the cowboy riding alongside his faithful horse.
- **[chorus]**: Celebrates the freedom of the cowboy's life but hints at underlying sadness.
- **[verse]**: Introduces a reminiscence of past love that haunts the cowboy.
- **[bridge]**: Explores themes of lost loves and dreams aligned with each shining star.
- **[chorus]**: Repeats the bittersweet reflection on the cowboy's life.
- **[outro]**: Concludes with the cowboy continuing his journey alone, accumulating more sorrow with time.
