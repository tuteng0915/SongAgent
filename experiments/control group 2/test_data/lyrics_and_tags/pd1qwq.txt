Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the avenue
Thinking 'bout the things we used to do
Every step feels so brand new
But it's you I'm missing, it's you

[chorus]
The one I'm missing is you
The only reason is you
In every moment, in all I do
It’s always been you, yeah true

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[verse]
Memories linger like a sweet perfume
Traces of us are everywhere in this room
And though you're gone, your light shines through
And it's you I'm dreaming of, it's you

[chorus]
The one I'm missing is you
The only reason is you
In every heartbeat, in all I knew
It’s always been you, nothing but true

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[bridge]
Soft whispers in the night
Moonlight dancing on water bright
Dreams carrying me back to you
In colors rich and skies so blue

[chorus]
The one I'm missing is you
The only reason is you
Through every season, there’s no-one new
It’s always been you, just me and you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[outro]
And as the stars shine above
I’ll keep singing my song of love
For you... yes, for you…
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
