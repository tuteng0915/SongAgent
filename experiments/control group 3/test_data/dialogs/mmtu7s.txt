Sure thing! Let's start by nailing down a few more specifics. What kind of themes or emotions would you like the lyrics to convey?
Agent : 
Great! Themes and emotions are crucial to setting the right tone for the song. Do you have any specific themes in mind, such as love, adventure, nostalgia, or perhaps something more abstract like freedom or hope? Additionally, how do you want the song to make listeners feel—energized, reflective, joyful, melancholic, etc.? 

Once we have this information, I can better tailor the lyrics and tags to suit your vision.
User : 
I want the song to feel dreamy and a bit haunting, with a sense of wonder. It should make listeners feel like they're floating through a surreal world.

I've set the tags for your song to reflect a dreamy, haunting, surreal, and wondrous atmosphere that gives a sense of floating. Now let's move on to crafting some lyrics that align with these themes.

Here’s a preliminary draft of the lyrics:

[Verse]
In a haze where the stars softly whisper
Drifting through the veils of the night's tender mist
A world unfolds in a spectral shimmer
Where shadows embrace, and dreams persist

[Chorus]
Floating beyond the skies of time
Through realms unseen, crossing the line
Voices echo from a distant sphere
Haunting melodies draw us near

[Bridge]
Wanderlust in this ghostly dance
Enchanted we are, caught in a trance
Beneath moons that guide our way
In this surreal ballet, we sway

The lyrics are nice, but can we add something about a Victorian-style character surrounded by floating sheep? It should feel whimsical and a bit weird.
Agent : 
Sure, let's incorporate that whimsical and slightly surreal element into the lyrics. Here’s an updated version of the song:

[Verse]
In a haze where the stars softly whisper
Drifting through the veils of the night's tender mist
A world unfolds in a spectral shimmer
Where shadows embrace, and dreams persist

[Chorus]
Floating beyond the skies of time
Through realms unseen, crossing the line
Voices echo from a distant sphere
Haunting melodies draw us near

[Bridge]
Wanderlust in this ghostly dance
Enchanted we are, caught in a trance
Beneath moons that guide our way
In this surreal ballet, we sway

[Verse 2]
Picture a gent in attire Victorian
Surrounded by sheep in a celestial mission
With top hat bowed and cane in hand
He drifts through clouds at fate's command

[Chorus 2]
Sheep float gently through the air
Their woolly forms, a sight so rare
Together they glide on moonlit seas
Bound by whispers of mysteries
