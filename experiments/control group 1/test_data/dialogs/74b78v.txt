To better understand your preferences and create a song that truly resonates with you, I'll gather some information on what you enjoy. Let's start by getting your preferences.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems like we're starting from scratch. No problem at all! Let's define the theme or emotion for your song. Do you want it to express love, narrate an adventure, convey a sense of loss, or perhaps something entirely different? Your choice will guide the lyrics and the mood of the music.

Once you provide a theme, I'll generate some sample lyrics and set the appropriate tags to match the style and emotion you're aiming for. Just let me know what direction you'd like to take!
