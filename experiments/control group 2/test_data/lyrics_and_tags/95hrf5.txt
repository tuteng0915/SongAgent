Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets at night,
Blue fur glows under neon light.
With my head held high, though I'm feeling low,
A hybrid soul in a world that won't let go.

[chorus]
They can laugh, they can shout,
But I'll rise, I'll stand out.
In this jacket, I find my shield,
A rebel heart, a warrior's yield.

[verse]
The cigarette burns as I breathe in deep,
Smoke spirals dance while secrets seep.
Alone but not lost, I've found my way,
Through the shadows cast by day.

[bridge]
Fists clenched tight, eyes blazing bright,
Against the bullies, I'll ignite.
Nocturnal whispers fuel my fight,
Underneath electric skies tonight.

[chorus]
They can mock, they can jeer,
But I'll thrive, have no fear.
With defiance stitched into my seams,
I am more than just dreams.

[outro]
And when the night fades to gray,
I'll still be here, come what may.
For within me lies strength untold,
A story of courage, both new and old.
