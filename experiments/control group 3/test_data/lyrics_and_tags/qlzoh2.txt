Lyrics :
[verse]
In the streets of Havana, echoes linger on,
Stories of a legend, Che, who's come and gone.
With a raspy whisper, tales begin to unfold,
Of revolution's fire, in hearts both young and old.

[chorus]
The strum of a guitar, beneath the Cuban moon,
A raspy voice sings songs, where heroes once stood tall.
Nostalgia in the air, as memories rewind,
To days of hope and dreams, in every corner of your mind.

[verse]
Through the alleys of time, where shadows gently play,
Che's spirit lingers, in each guitar's soft sway.
Voices blend with night's breeze, carrying dreams afar,
On wings of freedom's promise, like notes upon a star.

[bridge]
Lying in the sugar cane fields, under the sun so bright,
Guns resting beside us, as we dream through the night.
Revolution's children, playing where the whispers dwell,
In the heart of Cuba's soul, where stories never fell.
