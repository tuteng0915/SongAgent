Lyrics :
[verse]
Shadows stretch across the alleyway
Neon lights paint the wet pavement
Every step, a new story unfolds
In this concrete jungle, secrets hide

[chorus]
City whispers in the night
Echoes of footsteps, lost in flight
Underneath the moon's cold gaze
A solitary figure finds his way

[verse]
The hum of distant traffic fades
As he navigates through the urban maze
Voices echo, tales untold
In every corner, a mystery unfolds

[bridge]
Streetlights flicker, casting silhouettes
Of dreams pursued and regrets left
In this noir cityscape, he treads
With every heartbeat, a new chapter reads

[chorus]
City whispers in the night
Echoes of footsteps, lost in flight
Underneath the moon's cold gaze
A solitary figure finds his way
