Hello, song generating agent! I have a task for you. Instead of finding an existing song, could you generate a new song that matches the following description?

I'm looking for a catchy tune with dance/disco beats and strings throughout the song, reminiscent of "Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve but less sophisticated. The vocalist should be female, with a light and soft voice similar to Dido or Sheryl Crow. The chorus should include some "yeah yeah" parts. The overall vibe should be nostalgic, like a blast from the past, specifically from the early or mid-2000s.

Could you create such a song for me?
