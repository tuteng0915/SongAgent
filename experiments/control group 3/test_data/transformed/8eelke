Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. The strum pattern should be simple, and the song should be about a woman. It sounds like it would be performed by a solo artist rather than a band. There's a memorable part where the artist sings "she crazy," followed by a long, distinct falsetto that goes up and down. The style should be reminiscent of 70s-80s acoustic guitar music. Can you help me create something like this?
