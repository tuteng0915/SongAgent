Hey there! I'm looking to create a song that matches some specific vibes I've been thinking about. Here's what I'm picturing:

I want the song to be very upbeat, like something you'd hear at a lively party. It should have a pop-indie feel with a female vocalist. The theme of the song should revolve around a house, maybe capturing the energy and essence of a place filled with joy and excitement. Think of a scene with a house surrounded by multicolored animals, bringing a whimsical and vibrant visual to mind.

Can you generate a song based on these ideas?
