Lyrics :
[verse]
I see the sun setting low
I'm alive, take a look into my eyes
The excitement that I feel inside
Gonna take me for a ride

[chorus]
I'm riiiiiding up... I'm riding uuuup!
Feel the rush, it's never enough!
With every step, I'm breaking free
Riding high where the wild winds blow

[verse]
In your final hour
What a way to gooooo.
Memories they come and go
But this moment, it will grow

[bridge]
The mountains echo my refrain
As I journey through joy and pain
Together we'll reach for the skies
Colorado dreams in our eyes

[chorus]
I'm riiiiiding up... I'm riding uuuup!
Feel the rush, it's never enough!
With every step, I'm breaking free
Riding high where the wild winds blow
