Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking along the old dusty road,
Her hands filled with treasures untold.
In the twilight's gentle glow,
She finds hope in what others forego.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your love is a beacon of light,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
With every step that you bravely take,
A world of dreams for me you make.

[verse]
Through trials and storms she would stride,
With grace in her heart and hope by her side.
Each pebble and leaf, a story to tell,
Of a spirit unbroken, defying the well.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your love is a beacon of light,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
With every step that you bravely take,
A world of dreams for me you make.

[bridge]
Though the path may be weary and long,
Her song lifts me up, makes me strong.
In the echoes of her quiet fight,
I find my way, towards the light.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your love is a beacon of light,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
With every step that you bravely take,
A world of dreams for me you make.
