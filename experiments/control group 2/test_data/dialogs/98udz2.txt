Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a love song for me. The song should start with the singer making a statement followed by the phrase "that's a fact." Then, she should make another statement and follow it up with "That's a guess." This second statement should rhyme with a line about her love being endless. The style should be reminiscent of songs from the 90s or 2000s. Can you generate such a song for me?

I have generated a love song with the style reminiscent of songs from the 90s or 2000s. It includes heartfelt statements followed by "that's a fact" and "that's a guess," which rhymes with a line about endless love. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
I've loved you from the start,
That's a fact.
My heart knew when we met,
That's a guess.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.

[verse]
Together we'll create our story,
That's a pact.
Our journey filled with joy and glory,
That's exact.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight,
You are my beacon, my guiding light.
With every moment, with every chance,
I'll hold you close in this dance.

[chorus]
My love for you is endless,
In this world, you're my one and only princess.
With every breath and every sigh,
You're the reason I reach for the sky.
