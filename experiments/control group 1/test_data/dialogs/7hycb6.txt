Sure thing! Let's start by focusing on the vibe and structure. Do you prefer the verses to be more mellow or equally upbeat as the chorus?

It seems like you haven't shared your preferences yet. Could you let me know if you'd like the verses to be more mellow or equally upbeat as the chorus? This will help shape the overall vibe of the song. If you're not sure, we can go with a balanced approach where the verses are slightly mellow and the chorus picks up the energy. What do you think?
