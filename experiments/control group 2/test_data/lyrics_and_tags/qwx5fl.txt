Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the city where the lights are bright,
We'll dance through the night till the morning light.
Every step that we take, every move that we make,
We're painting this town in the colors of love, yeah.

[chorus]
You must be happy. You must be happy.
You must be happy in this woooooorld.
No time for worries, let your spirit unfurl,
You must be happy. You must be happy in this world.

[verse]
With the wind in our hair and the sun on our face,
We'll chase down the dream that we long to embrace.
Through the highs and the lows, we will always prevail,
Together we'll rise like a phoenix from the flame.

[chorus]
You must be happy. You must be happy.
You must be happy in this woooooorld.
No time for worries, let your spirit unfurl,
You must be happy. You must be happy in this world.

[bridge]
Oh oh oh, let the rhythm take control,
Feel the beat of the drum echo deep in your soul.
Let the music lift you higher and higher,
Dance until the dawn ignites the fire.

[chorus]
You must be happy. You must be happy.
You must be happy in this woooooorld.
No time for worries, let your spirit unfurl,
You must be happy. You must be happy in this world.
