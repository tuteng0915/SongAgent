Lyrics :
[verse]
I want yo love
I want yo time
Tieeiieem, tieeiieem
[chorus]
In this disco night
Under neon lights
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme
Together all the time
[bridge]
Dance with me, don't let go
Let the music take control
We'll keep dancing till the morning light
With our love shining bright
[chorus]
In this disco night
Under neon lights
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme
Together all the time
