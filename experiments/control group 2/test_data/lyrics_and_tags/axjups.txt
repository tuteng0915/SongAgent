Lyrics :
[verse]
Deep in the rhythm of the night
Feel the groove, it's outta sight
Can you dig it baby, let's go all night
Underneath the moonlight's glow

[chorus]
Oh oh can you dig it baby
The vibe is so crazy
With a little bit of love and a lot of soul
We're gonna make this party whole

[verse]
Spin me round, like a record spins
In the heart of the crowd where the music wins
Can you dig it baby, with your dancing pins
In this vibrant world that never dims

[chorus]
Oh oh can you dig it baby
The vibe is so crazy
With a little bit of love and a lot of soul
We're gonna make this party whole

[bridge]
Let's take it back to the days of old
When the music was worth more than gold
Together we'll unfold
Stories of the brave and bold

[chorus]
Oh oh can you dig it baby
The vibe is so crazy
With a little bit of love and a lot of soul
We're gonna make this party whole

[outro]
As the night fades away
Remember this moment, come what may
Can you dig it baby, till the break of day
