Lyrics :
[verse]
No regrets, nothing left to lose
I may not make it back
This night is mine, this night is mine

[chorus]
We fight on the hill, till one remains
Blood and sweat, in the pouring rain
The crown is heavy, but I'll bear the pain
King of the Hill, till the morning breaks

[verse]
Every step taken, another falls
The echo of battle, it calls and calls
With every breath, I hear the brawl
The summit's lonely, but worth it all

[bridge]
In the chaos, we find our way
Through the darkness, till the break of day
Each challenge faced, each price we pay
For the throne, for the throne we pray

[chorus]
We fight on the hill, till one remains
Blood and sweat, in the pouring rain
The crown is heavy, but I'll bear the pain
King of the Hill, till the morning breaks
