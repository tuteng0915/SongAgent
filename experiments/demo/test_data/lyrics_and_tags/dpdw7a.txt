Lyrics :
[verse]
In this submerged sanctuary, where silence sings,
Two hearts echo, like gentle flapping wings.
Through windows of seashells, where moonlight bends,
We drift together, our love transcends.

[chorus]
Breathing bubbles, beneath the glass,
An ocean of dreams, in this apartment cast.
With every sway, we softly confess,
A love that's as deep as the blue caress.

[verse]
Neon corals glow in twilight's embrace,
Our fingers entwined, tracing the streams of space.
Whispers of mermaid songs, in currents they flow,
Binding us closer, in this world we know.

[bridge]
Surreal tides turn, in this liquid room,
Where gravity fades, and souls consume.
The surface forgotten, drowned in night,
Together we're lost, in a sea of delight.

[chorus]
Breathing bubbles, beneath the glass,
An ocean of dreams, in this apartment cast.
With every sway, we softly confess,
A love that's as deep as the blue caress.
