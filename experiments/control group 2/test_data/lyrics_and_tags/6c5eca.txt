Lyrics :
[verse 1]
She was just a dreamer in her youth
Running wild under the moon's pursuit
With a heart so free and skies so blue
Every moment felt like a debut

[chorus]
Oh, the memories we made in those days gone by
A love that grew as the years went flying by
From the innocence of her laughter to the wisdom in her sigh
Our hearts entwined beneath the starlit sky

[verse 2]
In her teens, she danced with dreams anew
On the edge of hope, where the world seemed true
With every stumble, I was there to renew
The promise of tomorrow, a bond that grew

[chorus]
Oh, the memories we made in those days gone by
A love that grew as the years went flying by
From the innocence of her laughter to the wisdom in her sigh
Our hearts entwined beneath the starlit sky

[bridge]
Now she walks along the shoreline bare
Dressed in white, with the sun in her hair
Camera captures her essence rare
As she wanders without a care

[verse 3]
Grown-up now, yet still my muse
A reflection of our life's sweet hues
With eyes that tell of love's long dues
And lips that whisper 'I love yous'

[chorus]
Oh, the memories we made in those days gone by
A love that grew as the years went flying by
From the innocence of her laughter to the wisdom in her sigh
Our hearts entwined beneath the starlit sky

[outro]
Walking down the beach, with the waves' soft goodbye
Her silhouette fades into the twilight sky
But in my heart, she'll never say goodbye
For our love's eternal, like the sea and the sky
