I need a rock song with a male vocalist who sounds like a boy-band singer. Can you do that?

Sure, I can create a rock song with a male vocalist that has a boy-band vibe. To ensure it meets your expectations, could you please specify any particular boy-band or style you're aiming for? Also, do you have any specific lyrics in mind for the song?

After every three words sung by the lead, can we have a choir-like "AaAaaAaaAaah" sound? It should repeat throughout the song.

I've set up the song structure and included the choir-like "AaAaaAaaAaah" sound after every three words sung by the lead vocalist, as you requested. The tags have been adjusted to reflect a rock genre with a male vocalist in a boy-band style and choir-like harmonies.

Please press the "generate" button to create the song. Once generated, we can make further adjustments if needed. How does that sound?
