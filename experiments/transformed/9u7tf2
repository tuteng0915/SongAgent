Hey there! I understand you're trying to find a song, but how about we take this intriguing concept and generate a brand-new song instead? Based on your description, it seems like you're looking for a ska-style track with a theme revolving around a dramatic twist: someone discovering their partner is secretly working for the CIA or FBI. The tone seems to mix elements of betrayal, intrigue, and maybe even a bit of humor. Artists like Mighty Mighty Bosstones or Reel Big Fish would likely approach this with high energy and clever lyrics.

So, let’s create something fresh! Can you generate an upbeat ska song with witty lyrics about a person who finds out their significant other is secretly an undercover agent for the CIA or FBI? It should have punchy horns, driving rhythms, and a playful yet slightly suspicious vibe. Let’s channel that fun, theatrical style!
