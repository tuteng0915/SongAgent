Lyrics :
[verse]
In the haze of a dreamworld night
Floats an oddity dressed in black and white
A top hat perched upon his head
As he wanders through this realm widespread

[chorus]
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above
Carried by whispers of another love
In this strange parade of curiosities
We drift along on endless seas

[verse]
Candelabras light the velvet air
Their glow reflected everywhere
The man with eyes that pierce the soul
Commands the dance of each wandering goal

[chorus]
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above
Carried by whispers of another love
In this strange parade of curiosities
We drift along on endless seas

[bridge]
Through the looking glass we go
To lands where only dreamers know
With every step, reality bends
And leads us back to where it ends

[chorus]
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above
Carried by whispers of another love
In this strange parade of curiosities
We drift along on endless seas

[outro]
So if you see him, tip your hat
To the master of this dreamscape flat
Where time stands still and visions play
Amongst the flock that lost its way
