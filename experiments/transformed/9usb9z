Hello, Song Agent! I'm looking to generate a song based on some specific requirements. Here's what I have in mind:

## Sound:
- A slower tempo song that isn't sad but also not upbeat.
- Synth-heavy with a rhythmic "tchkahkahkah tchkahkahkah" sound and subtle background noise.
- Styled in 80s electronic music.
- Features a male vocalist, likely American.
- Possibly includes some guitar towards the end.

## Lyrics:
- Contains a phrase similar to "do do do dodo something for Michael" (with "Michael" being a placeholder for a manâ€™s name).
- The "do" parts are placeholders for forgotten words.
- Likely includes the word "for," though this is uncertain.

Could you help me generate a song that fits these criteria? Thank you!
