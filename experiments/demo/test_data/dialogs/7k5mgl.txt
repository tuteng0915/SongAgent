Sure thing! Let's start crafting your song. First off, should the song have a male or female lead singer, or perhaps both? And do you envision it as a duet or solo performance?
Agent : 
To better tailor the song to your preferences, let's gather a bit more information. 

Could you please share:
1. The preferred gender of the lead singer (male, female, or both)?
2. Whether you'd like this to be a solo performance or a duet?
3. Any specific themes or emotions you want the song to convey?
4. Do you have a preference for the genre or style of the music?

With these details, I can create something truly special for you!

A male lead singer sounds great. Let's keep it a solo performance with a lively vibe, and the theme is about a guy with bad luck in love. The genre can be pop or something catchy. How does that sound?

I've crafted a song that fits your description: featuring a male lead singer in a solo performance with a lively and catchy pop vibe. The theme revolves around a guy experiencing bad luck in love, yet maintaining hope.

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
He's the guy with the heart of gold
But his love life’s a story untold
Every time he tries, it goes wrong
But he keeps on singing his song

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true

[verse]
Underneath the neon lights
He dances alone every night
Searching for a sign or clue
That his heart will find something new

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true

[bridge]
The world keeps spinning round and round
But he won’t let it get him down
With a smile and a hopeful view
He knows his dreams will come true

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true

The lyrics are great, but I noticed the repeated line "She said let's just be friends" is missing. Could you add that in the chorus? Once that's done, we can generate the song.

I've updated the chorus to include the line "She said let's just be friends." Here are the revised lyrics:

[verse]
He's the guy with the heart of gold
But his love life’s a story untold
Every time he tries, it goes wrong
But he keeps on singing his song

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
She said let's just be friends
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true
