Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some specific details I remember. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should be in the pop punk genre, reminiscent of bands like Less Than Jake or Goldfinger. The song starts with someone mimicking a phone ringing sound using their voice, and during that ringing noise, there’s dialogue where someone says, “I know she’s home.” After the call is picked up, it turns into a phone conversation where the girl delivers some bad news to the guy—maybe she’s breaking up with him, telling him she cheated, or something along those lines.  

Can you generate lyrics for a song like this? It would also be cool if you could add tags so I can see how it fits within the pop punk style.
