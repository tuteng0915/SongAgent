User : 
I'm excited to help you with that! Let's start by clarifying a few details. What kind of mood or emotions should the song primarily convey?
Agent : 
To better understand your preferences and create a song that truly resonates with you, I'll be asking a few questions. 

Let's start by setting the mood of the song. Do you prefer something more upbeat and energetic, or would you like it to be slow and melancholic?


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems like we haven't received any specific preferences yet. No worries! Let's proceed with a general approach.

We'll aim for a song that is upbeat and energetic, which often appeals to a wide range of tastes. If you have any specific themes or emotions in mind, feel free to share them now.


Successfully set the parameter tags
Great! We've set the initial tags for our song to be "upbeat, energetic, pop, catchy, vibrant."

Now, let's generate the lyrics. I'll create a basic structure with a verse, chorus, and bridge. 

Hereâ€™s a draft:

[verse]
Walking down the street, feeling so free,
Sunshine on my face, living life happily.

[chorus]
We'll dance under the stars, feel the rhythm in our hearts,
Every moment's a celebration, let the music start.

[bridge]
In this journey, we find our way,
With every step, a brighter day.
