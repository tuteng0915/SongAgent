Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on the following idea: 

It should be an alternative rock song with a male vocalist. The core theme is about the frustration of people pretending to understand what someone else is going through, even though they really can’t. The lyrics should revolve around the idea of "You don't know what it's like to be me, so you can’t say anything." 

The song should build up tension throughout and end with a punchline where the singer admits something like, "And I don’t know what it’s like to be you either," followed by the music abruptly cutting off, leaving the listener with a strong sense of finality.

Can you generate that for me?
