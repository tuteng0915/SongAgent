Lyrics :
[intro]
Dreams in my eyes, chasing the skies
Life's a playground, where imagination flies

[verse]
Step by step, we grow up too fast
Holding onto memories from the past
Running through fields, climbing every tree
Innocence fading, reality calling me

[chorus]
We're kids at heart, never wanna let go
Reaching for stars, even when they don't show
Riding the waves of change, setting our sails
From storybooks to life tales

[rap]
