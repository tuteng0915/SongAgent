Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some specific ideas I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want it to be a pop or R&B style song, with a vibe that feels like it could’ve been released anytime from the 90s through the 2000s—or even more recently. It should feel mellow and laid-back, the kind of track you’d hear while chilling at a café or browsing through aisles at the store.

The lead vocalist should be female (or part of a girl group), and the chorus needs to evoke something warm and reflective. Maybe the hook starts with lines like:  
- "The one I’m missing is you"  
- "The only reason is you"  

Or perhaps something where the last word rhymes with “you,” like “do” or “true.” To add texture, I’d love for there to be backing vocals—other female voices—that sing softly in the background, either repeating “yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah” slowly or just vocalizing harmonies without words. That section should sound really soothing and dreamy.

For instrumentation, I’d like an unexpected touch—a xylophone, marimba, kalimba, or something similar. Something delicate but distinctive that adds a unique layer to the melody. Overall, the tempo should stay relaxed, making it easy listening but still emotionally resonant.

Think you can whip up something like this? Let me know how it turns out!
