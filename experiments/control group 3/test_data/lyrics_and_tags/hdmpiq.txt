Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the radio
Sunshine on my face, feeling so mellow
Grabbed my shades and hit the road
No place I'd rather be, no place I'd go

[chorus]
We're living life like it's golden
Dancing under neon lights
With old friends and new beginnings
Every moment feels so right

[verse]
Riding bikes down by the shoreline
Laughter in the air, everything's fine
Memories we'll keep, like photographs
In the album of our lives, forever they'll last

[bridge]
Oh, these are the days we'll remember
When we're old and grey, sitting by the fire
Stories we'll tell, of wild nights and dreams
Of chasing stars and teenage schemes

[chorus]
We're living life like it's golden
Dancing under neon lights
With old friends and new beginnings
Every moment feels so right
