User : 
I want a song that starts with vocals only or very light music, something like "Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana" or "La's," in a soft rock style. It should feel nostalgic and calm. Can you do that?

I've set up a song with a nostalgic and calm soft rock style, featuring a vocal intro with light music. Here are the sections of the lyrics I've created:

- **[intro]**: A simple vocal line to start the song softly.
- **[verse 1]**: Sets the scene of walking down memory lane.
- **[chorus]**: Recalls fond memories of dancing under the moonlight.
- **[verse 2]**: Continues reminiscing about past times by the river.
- **[chorus]**: Repeats the memorable nights spent together.
- **[bridge]**: Reflects on how time passes but memories stay.
- **[outro]**: Closes the song with the same gentle vocal line from the intro.
