Hey there, song generating agent! I have a unique song idea that I'd love for you to bring to life. I'm not looking to find an existing song, but rather generate a new one that captures these elements:

The song should start with the sound of a cashier machine, as if we're in a bustling store. Then, a smooth jazz guitar riff kicks in, setting a groovy and laid-back vibe. The lyrics are simple yet catchy, repeating the word "money" over and over with a reverb effect that gives it an echoing feel, making it memorable and hypnotic. This pattern continues throughout the song, creating a mesmerizing loop that's been stuck in my head for years.

Itâ€™s not by Pink Floyd, but it definitely has that timeless, entrancing quality. Can you create this song for me? 

Looking forward to what you come up with!
