I want a song that feels like the 80s, you know, with a powerful female voice. Something catchy and bold!
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that! To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about what you mean by "catchy and bold"? Do you have any specific themes or lyrics in mind for the song? Also, do you prefer any particular type of instrument or beat that would fit this vibe?
User : 
I'm thinking of something with a strong beat, maybe some dramatic shouting vocals. The lyrics could talk about taking risks, like "playing with fire" kind of vibe.

Great, I've got a clearer picture now. We'll go for a powerful beat with dramatic vocals and a theme centered around taking risks. Let's add some tags to capture the essence of an 80s vibe with a strong female lead.

I will set the tags and draft some lyrics based on your concept of "playing with fire." Here’s how I plan to proceed:

- **Tags:** 80s, powerful female voice, strong beat, dramatic, risk-taking
- **Lyrics:** Will include verses and a chorus that embody the spirit of taking bold risks.

Let me create this for you.

The lyrics are nice, but I was hoping for something more like the chorus of "Love Is a Battlefield." Can you tweak it to sound more like that? And maybe include "I'm gonna give you my heart" in the chorus?

I've updated the lyrics to better match the style of "Love Is a Battlefield" while incorporating your requested line, "I'm gonna give you my heart," into the chorus. Here’s the revised version:

- **Verse:**
  Walking through the shadows, dancing in the flames
  Every heartbeat echoes, calling out my name

- **Chorus:**
  I'm gonna give you my heart, but remember this one thing
  We’re playing with fire, love is a battlefield
  In the heat of the moment, there's no where we can run

- **Bridge:**
  And if we fall, we fall together
  Rising from the ashes, like a phoenix forever
