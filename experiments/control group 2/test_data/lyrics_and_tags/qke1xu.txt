Lyrics :
[verse]
Her name is Claire, she floats like air,
I call her name but she's never there.
She smiles at me, then slips away,
Another night fades to gray.

[chorus]
But I'll keep trying, yeah I'll take my chances,
Even if she tears apart my defenses.
She may not love me, but I'll still say,
At least I tried in every way.

[verse]
We walk the same streets, different dreams,
Her shadow stretches longer than it seems.
I write her letters, they're never sent,
A heart confined, a silent lament.

[chorus]
But I'll keep trying, yeah I'll take my chances,
Even if she tears apart my defenses.
She may not love me, but I'll still say,
At least I tried in every way.

[bridge]
Oh, the stars bear witness to my fight,
The sleepless nights and tears I hide from sight.
If destiny denies this fragile thread,
Then let regret be all thatâ€™s left unsaid.

[chorus]
And I'll keep trying, though hope diminishes,
Through every wound her beauty finishes.
She won't remember my name or face,
But I'll embrace what time can't erase.
