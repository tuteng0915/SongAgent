Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a cheerful song with a catchy beat that could be considered popular and possibly a bit older. The song should have a melody that includes the notes [F F D, F C D, F F D, F C D], which might be at the beginning or continue throughout the song. It would be great if the genre could be hip hop or rap, and if possible, include some kids' voices in it. Can you generate a song based on these requirements?

I've set up the tags and lyrics for your cheerful, catchy beat song with a popular and slightly older vibe. The melody includes the notes you specified, and I've blended in elements of hip hop or rap along with kids' voices. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
Yo, it's a sunny day, let's go out and play,
With a funky rhythm that we can all sway,
To the tune of F F D, yeah, that's the way,
F C D in the mix, come on, let's slay.

[chorus]
It's the melody we love, it's the sound of fun,
With a touch of the past, like an old number one,
In this hip hop jam, you'll find your stride,
Kids' voices joining in, side by side.

[bridge]
The beat goes on, it never stops,
Rapping with the kids, around the clock,
We're making music, let's make it tight,
Old-school vibes with a future bright.

[chorus]
It's the melody we love, it's the sound of fun,
With a touch of the past, like an old number one,
In this hip hop jam, you'll find your stride,
Kids' voices joining in, side by side.
