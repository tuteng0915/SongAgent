Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits the following description:  

- It should have a very early 2000s vibe.  
- The tone is really depressing, emotive, and somber.  
- The singer is female, with a voice that complements the melancholic mood.  
- I initially thought the song was called "Float," but let's take creative liberties with the title while keeping it thematically relevant.  

Can you craft something along these lines?
