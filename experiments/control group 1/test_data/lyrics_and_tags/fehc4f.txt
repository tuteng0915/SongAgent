Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I see a path that shines so bright.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.

[verse]
Every step feels lighter than before,
Doors open wide, thereâ€™s so much more.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.

[bridge]
Through the storms, through the rain,
We will find our way again.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.
