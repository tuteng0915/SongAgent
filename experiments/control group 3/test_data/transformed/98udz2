Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a love song for me. The song should start with the singer making a statement followed by the phrase "that's a fact." Then, she should make another statement and follow it up with "That's a guess." This second statement should rhyme with a line about her love being endless. The style should be reminiscent of songs from the 90s or 2000s. Can you generate such a song for me?
