Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique song idea that I'd love for you to bring to life. I'm looking for an instrumental/shoegaze style track that incorporates an interview clip of an old man sharing his nostalgic memories of Coney Island. The atmosphere should be dreamy and evocative, capturing the essence of days gone by and the charm of Coney Island. Can you generate such a song for me?
