Lyrics :
[verse]
Won't you come to me? Diana
In the night so weary
[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Let's go back to old Havana
Where the stars align in sweet surrender
[verse]
I remember those nights under neon lights
Dancing like no oneâ€™s watching
[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Take me back to that forgotten land
Where love was young and hearts were pounding
[bridge]
The world keeps spinning, but we can slow it down
Just you and me, lost in this melody
[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Let's fade away into tomorrow
With dreams of yesterday forevermore
