Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique request for you. I'd like you to generate a catchy rock/electronic style song based on some vague memories I have of a music video. Here are the details:

- The main character in the video is a guy playing what might be a guitar or a keyboard guitar.
- The setting is around a building with different apartments.
- The overall vibe of the song is a blend of rock and electronic music.

Could you please create a song that fits these criteria? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!

I've crafted a song that combines rock and electronic elements with catchy vibes, inspired by the setting you provided. Here are the sections of the lyrics:

[verse]
In the heart of the city where dreams reside,
A guy with his guitar takes the stage tonight.
Strumming chords through apartment halls,
The music floats and it lifts up us all.

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat,
Rock and electronic make hearts compete.
Catchy tunes that never fade,
In this urban serenade.

[verse]
Lights flash on as he plays his part,
Notes like stories from his heart.
In every room, a listener sways,
Bound by melodies in these neon days.

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat,
Rock and electronic make hearts compete.
Catchy tunes that never fade,
In this urban serenade.

[bridge]
From rooftop high to underground,
The sound travels far and wide unbound.
Each note a spark in the night so vast,
Creating memories built to last.

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm, feel the beat,
Rock and electronic make hearts compete.
Catchy tunes that never fade,
In this urban serenade.
