Hi, Iâ€™d like to generate a song that fits the following description:  

It should sound like something composed between 2005-2010, with a post-punk vibe. The first verse needs to start with the line:  
*"If you find a - letter under the mattress, please don't read it & just leave it alone."*  

Additionally, the chorus should feature the phrase *"It's not the same without you"* repeating throughout.  

Could you create this song for me?
