Lyrics :
[Intro]
Saxophone solo

[Verse 1]
In the dim light of the evening
The city hums with secrets untold
Walking down these streets of dreams
Where stories unfold

[Chorus]
Oh, the night is young and alive
With melodies that make our hearts revive
Underneath the starlit sky
We dance and we fly

[Verse 2]
The rhythm takes us higher
Lost in the music, we're one with the fire
Every note a brushstroke
Painting the night with desire

[Bridge]
Feel the beat, let it guide you
Through the haze, where the shadows play
In this moment, nothing else matters
Just the music and the sway

[Chorus]
Oh, the night is young and alive
With melodies that make our hearts revive
Underneath the starlit sky
We dance and we fly

[Outro]
As the night fades to morning
The echoes linger, softly adorning
Memories of a night well spent
With the saxophone's lament
