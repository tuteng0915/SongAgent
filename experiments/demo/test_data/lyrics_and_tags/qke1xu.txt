Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light
I see your shadow, it's my guiding light
Though you'll never know my heart's desire
I still walk on through the night

[chorus]
With a heart full of dreams and a soul set free
I love you more than you'll ever see
Against all odds, I stand my ground
Unrequited love, where I am bound

[bridge]
But I won't give in to the silence
Even when hope is lost in the distance
For every step I take without you
Is a testament to what I must do

[chorus]
