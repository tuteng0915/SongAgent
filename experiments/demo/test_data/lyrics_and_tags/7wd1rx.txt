Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, shadows dance with grace,
A stranger walks alone, through the foggy streets.
Whispers in the air, carry tales untold,
Eyes that pierce the dark, secrets they hold.

[chorus]
Stranger, who are you?
Lost in this endless hue,
Walking through the echoes, fading from view,
Stranger, where do you go?
When the world doesn't know,
If you ever find home, will you let me follow?
