Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night, under flapper's delight,
Where jazz and cocktails flow, we dance to the beat so tight.
Bop bop, hear the sound, as feet shuffle round,
The rhythm takes control, in this place where dreams are found.

[chorus]
Oh, the party never ends, with a Charleston twist,
Modern beats intertwine, as our spirits persist.
Bop bop, let it roll, through the highs and the lows,
In the roaring twenties' style, with a hip-hop close.

[verse]
Speakeasy whispers fill the air, secrets in every corner shared,
Underneath the moonlit glow, we revel without care.
Bop bop, keep it up, as the tempo flips,
Bringing past into present, with a rhythm that never slips.

[bridge]
From jazz to rap, the evolution unfolds,
A fusion of eras, a tale retold.
With every rhyme and every cheer,
We bridge the gap between here and yesteryear.

[chorus]
Oh, the party never ends, with a Charleston twist,
Modern beats intertwine, as our spirits persist.
Bop bop, let it roll, through the highs and the lows,
In the roaring twenties' style, with a hip-hop close.
