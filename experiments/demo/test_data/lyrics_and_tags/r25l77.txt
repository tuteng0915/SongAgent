Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of America, where dreams are born anew,
Every corner whispers tales, of a land both wild and true.

[chorus]
Oh, let's sail to a foreign land, chasing sunsets bold,
With our feet on the ground, but our hearts never old.
In this journey we find, a melody so sweet,
A blend of pop and rock, where our spirits meet.

[verse]
Cities light up with stories untold, as we dance through the night,
Feel the rhythm in our souls, under neon lights so bright.

[bridge]
The world is ours to explore, every path, every sound,
Together we'll create a symphony, that echoes all around.
