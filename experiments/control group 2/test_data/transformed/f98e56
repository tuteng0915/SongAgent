Hello, Song Agent! I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of an 80s or 90s pop vibe, something you might hear in a shopping mall with semi-synth sounds. The song should feature piano/synth and chimes, creating an up-tempo, bossa nova-like rhythm, reminiscent of "The Girl From Ipanema." It should also have a softer male vocal singing along with the melody. The overall feel should be light and breezy, like a shopping spree soundtrack, but a bit slower than "Vibe" by Cookie Kawaii. Can you help me create this?
