Lyrics :
[verse]
You nod your head like you get it all
But the words just bounce off the wall
I can see it in your eyes, you don't know what it's like
To walk this road alone

[chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[verse]
The silence screams louder than words ever could
Your advice feels more like nails in the wood
Every syllable cuts deep but misses the mark
'Cause empathy's a language we've lost in the dark

[chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[bridge]
It builds and builds, no release in sight
The pressure grows with every lie
You think you're helping, but you're breaking the seal
And I'm drowning in feelings I can't reveal

[final chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[punchline]
And I don't know what it's like... to be you either

[ending]
