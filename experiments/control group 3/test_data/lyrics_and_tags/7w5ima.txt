Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows I've been hiding,
Lost in the echoes of my mind.
Every step feels like I'm sliding,
Down this endless spiral of time.

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning in despair,
Lift me up from depths of pain.
I'm reaching out for someone to care,
Save me now, before I go insane.

[verse]
Shadows grow as hope is fading,
Silent screams are all that remain.
In this abyss where fear's invading,
Will I ever see the light again?

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning in despair,
Lift me up from depths of pain.
I'm reaching out for someone to care,
Save me now, before I go insane.

[bridge]
With every heartbeat, feel the power,
Rising from the ashes of decay.
In this moment, find a new hour,
Break these chains, and fly away.
