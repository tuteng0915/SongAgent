Lyrics :
[verse]
I heard them talking in the other room
Their whispers cut like a knife
Every word was like a poison
Spreading through my life

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[verse]
It's like they feed on dirty laundry
Hanging out for all to see
I try to block it out but it's everywhere
In every corner of this house

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[bridge]
I'm tired of living in a fishbowl
With everyone watching my every move
Can't we find a place where we can be free
Where our private lives are ours to keep

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[chorus]
Close those doors, keep it inside
Let's not let the world in on our lives
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
