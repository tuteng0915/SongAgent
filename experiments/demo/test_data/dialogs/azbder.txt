I want a song that has a nostalgic vibe, kind of like the music from the 90s to early 2000s. Can you do that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create a song with a nostalgic vibe reminiscent of the 90s to early 2000s. To make it more personalized, could you tell me what kind of themes or emotions you'd like the lyrics to convey? For example, should it be about love, friendship, or perhaps a memorable journey? Also, do you prefer a slow ballad or an upbeat tune?


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences yet, I'll go ahead and create a song with a nostalgic vibe that could fit a variety of themes. Let's make it an upbeat tune to capture that lively spirit of the 90s to early 2000s.

I'll set the tags and lyrics for the song now.

 [verse]
Remember the days when the world was gold
Mix tapes and Walkmans, stories untold
Dancing in rooms where the moonlight beams
Living those dreams, living those dreams

[chorus]
Oh, we'll go back in time
To the rhythm and the rhyme
When the music played loud
And our spirits were never down
In the era of fun, under the neon sun
We danced through the night till the morning comes

[verse]
Skateboards rolling on the concrete waves
Denim jackets, simple trends, setting us brave
Video games and the TV glow
Back when things were easy, and everyone would know

[chorus]
Oh, we'll go back in time
To the rhythm and the rhyme
When the music played loud
And our spirits were never down
In the era of fun, under the neon sun
We danced through the night till the morning comes

[bridge]
Time may pass, but memories stay
In our hearts, they'll forever play
The echoes of laughter, the tunes so sweet
A timeless journey, where souls compete

It's missing something... I was thinking it could be more cinematic, like it belongs in a movie soundtrack. Can we tweak it to have that vibe?
