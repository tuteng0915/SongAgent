Lyrics :
[verse]
We walked the old fence line
Where shadows used to fall
Your laughter still lingers
But it's a ghost of it all

[chorus]
Unspoken words, they linger like the rain
Falling on fields where our hearts remain
I see your face in every setting sun
A love unspoken, now the day is done

[verse]
These dusty roads remember
The steps we didn't take
Each one a silent promise
A moment we couldn't make

[chorus]
Unspoken words, they linger like the rain
Falling on fields where our hearts remain
I see your face in every setting sun
A love unspoken, now the day is done

[bridge]
Time moves slow but it won't rewind
All those chances we left behind
If I could turn back the hands of time
Would you still be mine?

[chorus]
Unspoken words, they linger like the rain
Falling on fields where our hearts remain
I see your face in every setting sun
A love unspoken, now the day is done

[outro]
The echoes fade, but memories stay
In this bittersweet country ballet
