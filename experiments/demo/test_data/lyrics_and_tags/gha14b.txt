nostalgic, reflective, old letters, forgotten memories, 2005-2010 era, finding a letter under the mattress, soft, emotional, post-punk, raw, gritty
Lyrics :
[verse]
In the attic of my mind, I find
Old letters, faded with time
Each one a whisper of you and I
A fleeting moment, frozen in time

[chorus]
Oh it's not the same without you
Rekindle the flame of what used to be
In this quiet room, where shadows play
I recall the echoes of yesterday

[verse]
Underneath the mattress, there it lay
A letter from those simpler days
Words once so bold, now softly spoken
Promises made, promises broken

[bridge]
Time moves on, yet here I stay
Holding onto yesterday
Though the world outside has changed
These memories remain unchained

[chorus]
Oh it's not the same without you
Rekindle the flame of what used to be
In this quiet room, where shadows play
I recall the echoes of yesterday
