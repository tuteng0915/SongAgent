Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre and the overall vibe of the song. You mentioned an indie rock vibe, right? Any specific elements or instruments you'd like to highlight in the song?
Agent : 
Yes, let's proceed with the indie rock vibe. To better tailor the song to your preferences, could you please specify any particular themes or emotions you want the lyrics to convey? Additionally, are there any specific instruments or sounds you'd like to be prominent in the track?

Once I have this information, I will use it along with your preferences to generate suitable tags and lyrics for the song.

It seems I need more specific information from you to proceed. Could you please share your preferences regarding the themes, emotions, and any specific instruments or sounds you'd like to be included in the song? This will help me generate a song that aligns perfectly with your vision.

Let's keep it simple and focus on the heartfelt message for now. Instruments are not that important to me.

[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light
I find my thoughts drifting to you
Every word unsaid, every promise made
Lingers like the morning dew

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

[verse]
Walking down these streets we used to know
Each corner holds a memory or two
The laughter, the tears, the moments so dear
Are etched forever in everything I do

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

[bridge]
And if the world falls apart
And if the stars lose their shine
I'll be here by your side
With every breath, with all my time

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

User : 
The lyrics are nice, but can we make it more personal? Like directly addressing my mom and sister?
Agent : 
Absolutely, making the lyrics more personal can really enhance the emotional impact. I'll adjust the lyrics to directly address your mom and sister. Let's update the lyrics accordingly.

I will now set the revised lyrics.

Underneath this starlit sky
Forever strong, forever true
This song is for me, mom, and sis too
