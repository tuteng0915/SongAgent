User : 
Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe and theme. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want the song to capture that chaotic, mischievous energy of someone unintentionally causing mayhem as they go about their day in a carefree way—like bumping into things and tossing objects aside without realizing the chain reactions they’re setting off behind them. The tone should be colorful, fun, and a little wild, matching the kind of quirky humor you'd see in an over-the-top music video.

For style, let’s aim for something inspired by pop punk or California punk bands—high-energy, catchy, with just enough edge to keep it cool but not too serious. Think upbeat rhythms, maybe some crunchy guitar riffs, and lyrics that tell this story of accidental chaos with a playful twist.

Can you help me generate a song like that?

```
[verse]
Walking through the world like a bull in a china shop,
Knocking things over without even a stop.
I didn't mean to cause a mess,
But now it's chaos and I'm loving the stress.

[chorus]
Oops, there goes another vase,
And I just knocked my coffee off its place.
The room’s spinning, everything’s a blur,
This is my life, ain’t it absurd?

[verse]
Every step I take leaves a trail of surprises,
Like dominoes falling before my eyes.
It's all fun and games till someone gets hit,
But who needs calm when you can live like this?

[bridge]
Crash! Bang! Boom!
Life's one big cartoon,
With every door I slam,
Another joke begins again.

[chorus]
Oops, there goes another vase,
And I just tripped on my own shoelace.
The room’s alive, it’s outta control,
But deep inside, I’ve found my soul.
```
