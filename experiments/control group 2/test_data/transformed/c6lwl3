Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on some details I remember. It’s an alternative/indie rock song, and the theme is about a boy's first time, but it didn’t live up to the hype his friends had built it up to be. There are lyrics that mention something like "she takes his hand and takes him up the stairs" and another part about "hips pressed into mine." I thought it might be by Stray Light Run, but I couldn’t find anything.

Can you generate a song with these features? Let’s call it an alternative/indie rock song with reflective and somewhat disillusioned lyrics about youthful experiences.
