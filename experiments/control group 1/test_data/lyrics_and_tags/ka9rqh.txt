Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding through the plains so wide,
With my faithful horse by my side.
We chase the sunset, far and high,
Underneath the western sky.

[chorus]
Oh cowboy's life, wild and free,
Heart as boundless as the sea.
But when the night begins to fall,
The silence whispers, one and all.

[verse]
The campfire flickers, softly fades,
Memories of love that couldn't stay.
Her laughter still haunts these lands,
A ghost in the sand, a trembling hand.

[bridge]
For every star that brightly shines,
Another tale of woe aligns.
Lost loves and dreams forever gone,
Beneath cold moonlight, I carry on.

[chorus]
Oh cowboy's life, wild and free,
Heart as boundless as the sea.
But when the night begins to fall,
The silence whispers, one and all.

[outro]
As dawn breaks, I ride alone,
To horizons vast, where shadows roam.
With each new day, another tear,
In this cowboy's journey, year by year.
