Given the chaotic character thriving in a bustling city at night, I imagine the song to have an energetic and mysterious vibe, with elements of intrigue and suspense. Let's use tags that reflect this mood: `urban, night, chaos, energetic, mysterious`.

I've set the tags and lyrics for the song based on the chaotic character in a bustling city at night. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
In the shadows where secrets lie
City whispers under the sky
Neon lights paint the deceit
Every corner, a new deceit

[chorus]
Dancing through the chaos, unseen
Strings pulled in the urban scene
Minds tangled in this nightly game
Where no one knows your real name

[verse]
Footsteps echo on rain-soaked streets
Silhouettes move with silent feats
Eyes watching from every pane
In this chaos, nothingâ€™s in vain

[bridge]
The night is alive, hearts collide
Invisible threads, they cannot hide
The puppeteer in the city's breath
Breathing life into the dance of death

[chorus]
Dancing through the chaos, unseen
Strings pulled in the urban scene
Minds tangled in this nightly game
Where no one knows your real name
```
