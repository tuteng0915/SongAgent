Lyrics :
[verse]
Now I'm rolling down the highway
With my cowboy hat on high
I've got a truck full of troubles
But I'm feeling kinda fly

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun

[verse]
Got my guitar on my shoulder
And a song in my heart
Every little town I go to
Is where the party starts

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun

[bridge]
From the mountains to the valleys
To the rivers and the plains
Everyone's got a story
And I'm here to entertain

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun
