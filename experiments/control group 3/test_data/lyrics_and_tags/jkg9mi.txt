Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these old streets again,
Where echoes of laughter linger like rain.
Every corner holds a ghost of yesterday,
In the twilight's gentle decay.

[chorus]
Oh, time won't rewind, though I beg and plead,
Memories bloom like forgotten seeds.
Sweet and painful, they pull at my soul,
In this dance of shadows, I'm not whole.

[verse]
Leaves fall like letters we never sent,
Each one a story, a moment misspent.
Autumn whispers secrets in hues of gold,
Of dreams that were young, now growing old.

[bridge]
Remember the rain, how it held us inside,
Windows fogged, where secrets would hide.
Trapped in time, yet somehow set free,
In your quiet company, I found my sanctuary.

[chorus]
Oh, time won't rewind, though I beg and heed,
Lessons learned are the soul's own creed.
Bittersweet symphony, playing through my mind,
In the echoes of time, solace I find.
