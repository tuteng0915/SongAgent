I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of what I'm thinking of. The song should have an upbeat tempo, reminiscent of bands like MGMT or Polyphonic Spree, but unique in its own right. It should feature a female lead singer and evoke the feeling of a well-choreographed dance number involving lots of people. The overall aesthetic should be colorful, with a vibrant palette of primary colors like red, yellow, and blue. The vibe should be modern, fitting into the post-2000 timeframe. Can you create something based on these ideas?
