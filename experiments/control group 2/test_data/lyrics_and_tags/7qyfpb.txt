Lyrics :
[verse]
...from the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver...

[chorus]
Classic beats in the air, feel the vibe so rare
East Coast tales we share, stories beyond compare

[bridge]
Gritty streets and soulful nights, under neon lights
Creative rhymes take flight, reaching new heights

[verse 2]
In this era of sound, where legends are found
Boom bap echoes around, as feet leave the ground
