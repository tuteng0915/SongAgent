Lyrics :
[verse]
Every step I take is like a beat in my heart
Every move I make, I'm breaking free, I'm apart

[chorus]
All my life, I've been waiting for this moment to arrive
All my life, chasing dreams that seem so far but now they're here

[verse]
With every breath, I feel the music taking control
And with every sound, there's nothing left to hold

[chorus]
All my life, I've been waiting for this moment to arrive
All my life, chasing dreams that seem so far but now they're here

[bridge]
I can hear the crowd, their cheers lift me higher
In this moment, I am unstoppable, my spirit on fire

[chorus]
All my life, I've been waiting for this moment to arrive
All my life, chasing dreams that seem so far but now they're here
