That sounds like a great direction! Before we proceed, I want to make sure we capture exactly what you're envisioning. Could you share any specific themes or elements you'd like included in the song? For example, any particular memories or feelings from school days you want to highlight? 

Also, do you have a preference for the tempo or any specific instruments you'd like to feature? This will help us tailor the song even more to your liking.

  Walking down these halls, we've been friends through it all,
  Dreams as big as the sky, reaching out so high.

  [Chorus]
  Together we'll chase every dream,
  In this wild, crazy teenage scene.
  With our hearts on fire, we'll never tire,
  Of chasing stars until they're ours.

  [Verse 2]
  Late night talks and plans made under moonlit skies,
  Our friendship's bond that never fades, it never dies.

  Oh, oh-oh, let's make memories to last forever,
  Oh, oh-oh, in this journey we call life together.

  [Chorus]
  Together we'll chase every dream,
  In this wild, crazy teenage scene.

  Of chasing stars until they're ours.

  And to those dreams ahead, shining bright, not yet bled.
