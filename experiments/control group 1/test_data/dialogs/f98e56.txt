It seems like we haven't set any preferences yet. Since you're considering between pop and bossa nova, let's go with a blend of both genres to create something unique. I'll set the genre tag to "pop, bossa nova" for now. If you'd like to adjust this or add more details such as mood or tempo, please let me know!

Great! We've set the genre tags to "pop, bossa nova." Now, let's work on the lyrics. Here's a basic structure for the song:

[verse]
In the morning light I see your smile
It warms my heart and makes me dial
The number that I know by heart
To hear your voice before I start

[chorus]
Oh, how I love you so
In this world of fast-paced woe
You're my calm in the stormy weather
Together we'll last forever

[verse]
Evening comes with stars above
Thinking of you fills me with love
I'll send a kiss through the air tonight
Hoping it reaches you alright

[chorus]
Oh, how I love you so
In this world of fast-paced woe
You're my calm in the stormy weather
Together we'll last forever

[bridge]
Every beat, every rhythm we share
In this dance of life, you're always there
With every step, with every sway
Our hearts sing in perfect ballet

[chorus]
Oh, how I love you so
In this world of fast-paced woe
You're my calm in the stormy weather
Together we'll last forever
