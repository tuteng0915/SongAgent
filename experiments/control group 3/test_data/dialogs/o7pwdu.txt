User : 
I want to create a song that has a late 90s alternative rock feel, something that could have been a radio hit. Can you start working on that?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about what you're looking for? Do you have any specific themes or emotions in mind for the lyrics? Also, do you prefer a male or female vocalist, or is that not important? 

Once I have this information, I'll set the tags and create the lyrics for your song. After that, you'll need to press the "generate" button to create the song.
User : 
The song should be about a slacker who thinks he's the hero of his own story, with a male singer. It should be catchy but also kind of cheesy, you know what I mean?

```
[verse]
Woke up late again, sun's shining bright
Another day, just killin' time tonight
I'm the king of my world, though it's kinda small
Got no plans, but I'll take on all

[chorus]
Slacker superstar, living in my head
Dreaming 'bout the life, where I always get ahead
Though I might not shine, I'm still the main act
In this one-horse town, I'm the hero in fact

...

[outro]
So here's to the slackers, the dreamers, the lost
To each their own crown, no matter the cost
For in our own stories, we all play a part
Even us slackers, with our big-hearted hearts
```

Please press the "generate" button when you're ready to create the song.

[verse]
Chillin' with my friends, we don't need no scene
Just some chips and dips, we're livin' the dream
The future's wide open, or so we say
Tomorrow's just another day to play

Slacker superstar, living in my head
Dreaming 'bout the life, where I always get ahead
Though I might not shine, I'm still the main act
In this one-horse town, I'm the hero in fact

[bridge]
We laugh at the world, from our couches we peek
At the lives we could lead, if we weren't so meek
But heroes come in many forms, you see
And mine's as good as theirs can be

Slacker superstar, living in my head

The tags and lyrics you've generated seem to capture the vibe I'm looking for. However, can we make sure it has that one-hit wonder feel? You know, something that could have been overplayed on MTV back in the day? Once that's confirmed, I'll press the "generate" button.
Agent : 
To give the song that one-hit wonder feel reminiscent of heavy MTV rotation, I'll tweak the tags to emphasize a catchy melody and an anthemic quality that was often present in those types of hits.

Let's update the tags to capture this essence:

- **Updated Tags:** late 90s alternative rock, male vocalist, slacker anthem, catchy melody, anthemic, cheesy, MTV hit
