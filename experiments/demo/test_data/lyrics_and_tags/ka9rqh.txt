Lyrics :
[verse]
In the dust of the desert, where shadows fall
A lone silhouette rides, at the break of dawn
With a heart full of sorrow, and a memory so raw
He's chasing the ghost of a love lost in the law

[chorus]
Oh, the winds they cry with a mournful sound
Through canyons deep and the open ground
Haunted by her face, under moonlit skies
The cowboy rides on, with tears in his eyes

[verse]
Harmonica wails as the sun sets low
His spurs echo softly through the canyons below
Each step he takes, is a heavy stone
On this endless journey, searching for a home

[chorus]
Oh, the winds they cry with a mournful sound
Through canyons deep and the open ground
Haunted by her face, under moonlit skies
The cowboy rides on, with tears in his eyes

[bridge]
The stars hang low, like lanterns in the sky
Guiding him forward, though he longs to die
With every step, the past fades away
But her memory lingers, till his dying day

[verse]
Under the cover of night, a shot rings out clear
The cowboy falls silent, his fate drawing near
In the arms of his woman, he breathes his last sigh
Together they're silent, beneath the starlit sky
