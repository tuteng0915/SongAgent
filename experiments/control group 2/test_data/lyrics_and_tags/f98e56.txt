Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the mall, feeling so free
Synths and chimes, that's my melody
[chorus]
Oh, it's a light and breezy day
With a sound that takes me away
In this tempo, I gently sway
To the rhythm of the shopping spree way
[verse]
Every step I take, music in the air
Soft male vocals, with the beat so rare
[chorus]
Oh, it's a light and breezy day
With a sound that takes me away
In this tempo, I gently sway
To the rhythm of the shopping spree way
[bridge]
Semi-synth sounds paint the atmosphere
Bossa nova beats, they draw me near
[chords]
The piano joins in, with grace and flair
A soundtrack for the stroll without a care
[chorus]
Oh, it's a light and breezy day
With a sound that takes me away
In this tempo, I gently sway
To the rhythm of the shopping spree way
