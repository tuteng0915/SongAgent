Lyrics :
[verse]
Spinning round in a sudsy dream
Dance floor magic in a laundry scene
Jeans and shirts they twirl and sway
In this chaotic wash and play

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone

[verse]
Sneaky glances as clothes tumble dry
Secret whispers beneath the sky
Laughter echoes as quarters chime
In this wild dance against time

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone

[bridge]
Spin cycle grooves, rinse and repeat
Every moment feels so bittersweet
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the spin
Laundromat nights where love might begin

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone
