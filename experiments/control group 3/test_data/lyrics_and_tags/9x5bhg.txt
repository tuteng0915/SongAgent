Lyrics :
[verse]
Driving down Mulholland's spine,
Where shadows dance and wheels hum with secrets untold.
Curves whisper tales in the moonlight,
A silent symphony beneath the starlit sky.

[chorus]
Oh, the curves of Mulholland,
In the heart of the night so still and grand.
Every twist a story, every turn a dream,
On this road where mysteries gleam.

[bridge]
The city lights below flicker like fireflies,
As we journey through the night, under endless skies.
Each moment etched in time, a fleeting embrace,
Of the winding path that leads us through this place.
