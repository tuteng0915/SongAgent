Lyrics :
[verse]
In a small town where whispers run deep
Lives a soul with a secret to keep
Lost between worlds, not here nor there
A boy or a girl, they're never quite sure

[chorus]
We rise above the ashes of our past
Misfits and dreamers, we're breaking free at last
Together we stand, in this world so vast
Outcasts united, finding home at last

[verse]
Running through shadows, she hides her face
Bruises beneath, a troubled grace
Stories untold, in silence she cries
A rebel in heart, with fire in her eyes

[chorus]
We rise above the ashes of our past
Misfits and dreamers, we're breaking free at last
Together we stand, in this world so vast
Outcasts united, finding home at last

[bridge]
No more chains, no more fears
In this tribe, we all belong here
Hand in hand, we'll rewrite our fate
With every step forward, it's never too late

[chorus]
We rise above the ashes of our past
Misfits and dreamers, we're breaking free at last
Together we stand, in this world so vast
Outcasts united, finding home at last
