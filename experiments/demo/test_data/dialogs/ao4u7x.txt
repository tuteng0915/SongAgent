I'd like a song that feels like the 2010s alternative scene, with a chain-like beat and a soulful female singer. Can you work with that?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular themes or emotions you want the lyrics to convey? Also, do you have a preferred length or structure for the song?
User : 
The lyrics should feel like being underwater, immersive and evocative. Something soulful, you know? And keep it around 4 minutes.

[verse]
Diving deep into the blue,
Where light fades and dreams ensue.

Floating here in silence deep,
In this world where secrets sleep.

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call,
Underwater walls.
Lost among the bubbles,
In this ocean of troubles.

[verse]
Weightless in a liquid embrace,
Time slows down, leaves no trace.

[bridge]
Surface far above,
Here, where shadows love.

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call,
Underwater walls.
Lost among the bubbles,
In this ocean of troubles.

[outro]
Rising slowly to the sky,
Leaving depths where dreams comply.
