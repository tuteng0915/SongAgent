Hey there! I understand you're trying to find a song that's been stuck in your head, but how about we take those details and create something new instead? Let's craft a soft rock ballad with a dramatic tone, perfect for pivotal movie moments. The style will feature a male vocalist, mainly driven by piano, with an emotive chorus that repeats a line like "Don't let me goooooooo" (or maybe "down," "drown," or "die"). It'll have that timeless, cinematic feel.

Can you generate a song based on these features?

Alright, I've set the parameters for your soft rock ballad. The song has a dramatic tone with a male vocalist and is mainly driven by piano, featuring an emotive chorus. Here are the lyrics we've crafted:

[verse]
In the quiet of the night I hear your echo
A whisper in the dark, it pulls me under
I reach for you but you're slipping like water
Through my fingers, gone too soon

[chorus]
Don't let me go, don't let me down
In this moment, I'm begging please
Stay with me now, don't let me drown
Hold on to love, don't let me leave

[verse]
Every heartbeat's a reminder of your absence
The silence is so loud it deafens my spirit
I'm searching for a light to guide me homeward
But without you, there's only fear

[chorus]
Don't let me go, don't let me down
In this moment, I'm begging please
Stay with me now, don't let me drown
Hold on to love, don't let me leave

[bridge]
If I could turn back time, rewrite our story
I'd find a way to keep you close beside me
Forever yours, through all eternity
Together we stand, never will I leave

[chorus]
Don't let me go, don't let me down
In this moment, I'm begging please
Stay with me now, don't let me drown
Hold on to love, don't let me leave
