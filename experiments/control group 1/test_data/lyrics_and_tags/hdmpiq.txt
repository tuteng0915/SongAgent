Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night, I see the light
Guiding me forward, making wrongs right

[chorus]
We rise, we rise, towards the sky
With dreams that never die
Together we stand, hand in hand
Hope is the strength we share, across this land

[verse]
Through every storm, through every fight
We hold on tight, keeping our sight

[chorus]
We rise, we rise, towards the sky
With dreams that never die
Together we stand, hand in hand
Hope is the strength we share, across this land

[bridge]
And when the shadows fall
And hope seems lost, we'll give it our all
For every heartbeat, for every soul
The fire within us will make us whole

[chorus]
We rise, we rise, towards the sky
With dreams that never die
Together we stand, hand in hand
Hope is the strength we share, across this land
