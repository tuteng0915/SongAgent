User : 
Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that has a call and response style. The vibe I'm going for is something where they draw out the first "yeahh" and then start saying it faster. It should feel like a classic rock or "oldies" type of track. Can you help me create something like that?

Sure, I can help you create that song. Since we're going for a call and response style with a classic rock or "oldies" vibe, let's set some appropriate tags and lyrics.

For the tags, we'll go with: classic rock, oldies, call and response, energetic, upbeat.

Now, for the lyrics, here's a draft:

[Verse]
Yeahhh...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey now, hey now
This is our time to shine
Hey now, hey now
Let's keep it in rhythm and rhyme
