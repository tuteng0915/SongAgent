Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on some details I have. It's a pop/rock song with a male vocalist, and it seems like he's speaking to his partner. The only lyric I remember is: 

"Im sitting on my own here with you"

This line is the second part of a sentence and is sung in a downward progressing tone. Can you generate a song that fits these features? Thanks a lot!

I've been thinking 'bout the times we've had
Im sitting on my own here with you

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new

[verse]
Our love is strong, it's all we need
Let's keep moving forward with speed

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new

[bridge]
There's no one else I'd rather be with tonight
Than you, my shining light

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new
