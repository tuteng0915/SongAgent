Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the quiet of the evening,  
Underneath the starlit sky so bright,  
Your hand in mine, we walk together,  
Every moment feels just right

[Chorus]
You're my sunshine in the morning,  
My lighthouse in the night,  
With you, everything is perfect,  
Our love shining ever so bright

[Bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight,  
We hold each other tight,  
In this world full of chaos,  
You are my guiding light

[Verse 2]
I love spending time with you, that's a fact,
Endless as the stars above, that's a guess,
With every heartbeat, with every breath,
Together we'll conquer any stress.
