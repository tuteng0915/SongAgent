User : 
I want a song that feels like the transition from being a kid to an adult, with a pop and rap style. Can you start by giving me something with a dreamy and playful intro?

Sure, I can help with that. Since you're looking for a song that captures the transition from childhood to adulthood with a pop and rap style, and you want it to start with a dreamy and playful intro, I'll go ahead and set those tags for you.

I'll also draft some lyrics that fit this theme.

I've set the tags to reflect a pop and rap style song with a dreamy and playful intro that represents the transition from being a kid to an adult. Here are the lyrics I've drafted so far:

[intro]
Dreams in my eyes, chasing the skies
Life's a playground, where imagination flies

[verse]
Step by step, we grow up too fast
Holding onto memories from the past
Running through fields, climbing every tree
Innocence fading, reality calling me

[chorus]
We're kids at heart, never wanna let go
Reaching for stars, even when they don't show
Riding the waves of change, setting our sails
From storybooks to life tales

[rap]

Now you can press the "generate" button to create the initial version of the song. Once you have it, we can continue refining or extending it as you wish.
