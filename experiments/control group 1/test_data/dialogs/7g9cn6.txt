I need a song with a spoken-word intro where a guy vents about being hurt by a girl. He's angry and talking over guitar strumming for about 15 seconds. The song should be angsty, reflecting betrayal but also reclaiming power. Can you create this?

I've set up the song with an angsty vibe, capturing feelings of betrayal and reclaiming power. It starts with a spoken-word intro where the guy vents his anger over guitar strumming for about 15 seconds. Here's a snippet of what the lyrics look like:

[spoken-word intro]
You think you can just walk all over me?
I gave you everything, trusted you with my soul,
and this is how you repay me?

[chorus]
Broken promises, shattered dreams,
Your deceitful whispers cut deeper than it seems.
But I rise from the ashes of your lies,
Stronger than ever, watch me fly.

[verse]
The scars you left are fading now,
Pain turns to power, I'll show you how.
Every heartbeat fuels my fire,
In the end, you'll see I'm the one who's higher.
