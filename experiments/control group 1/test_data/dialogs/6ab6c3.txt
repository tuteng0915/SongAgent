User : 
I want to create a song with a late 90s or early 2000s alternative/grunge vibe. Can you work with that?

Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular bands or songs from that era you're fond of? If not, I'll just go ahead and set the tags based on a typical late 90s/early 2000s alternative/grunge style.
