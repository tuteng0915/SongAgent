[verse]
Woke up to the sunrise, feeling alive
Got my best friends with me, we'll survive
Every moment's a gift, can't you see
Let's chase the horizon, just you and me

We're living life, no time to slow down
Adventures calling, let's take that crown
Together we'll find every dream we've found
Living life to the fullest, all around

[verse]

Memories in snapshots, they won't fade
In this journey of love, unafraid
