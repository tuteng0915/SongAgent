Lyrics :
[verse]
I saw him in the rearview mirror
Fading away like a dream that lingers
Shoulda known better than to let him go
Now I'm left here with my heart on show

[chorus]
Regretting all those words unsaid
Wishing for another chance instead
He was my guide, but I played the fool
Lost in this game, now I'm breaking all the rules

[verse]
In my mind, he's still by my side
Walking down those streets where we used to hide
But reality hits, and he's long gone
A phantom of memories, playing his song

[bridge]
And just when I thought I understood
The reason why our bond never stood
A letter came, and it changed it all
Turns out he wasn't mine to call

[chorus]
Regretting all those words unsaid
Wishing for another chance instead
He was my guide, but I played the fool
Lost in this game, now I'm breaking all the rules

[outro]
The truth is bitter, but it sets me free
He was never truly mine, you see
Still, I miss him, and that's my plight
Loving a shadow in the dead of night

[beat drop]
And as the beat drops, the truth unfolds
This story's not of lovers, but of old
A father's love cut short by fate
It's his memory that I hold, not an ex-lover's slate
