Lyrics :
[verse]
In the lab where shadows grow
Equations dance, we're in the flow
Microchips whisper, secrets untold
Binary beats echo, brave and bold

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back?

[verse]
Logarithms leap, they twist and turn
Through cosmic loops for which we yearn
A paradox lies in every byte
Where truth is blurred by endless night

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back?

[bridge]
Beneath the glow of the CRT
We code our fate, yet none are free
The future calls with static sound
As man and machine spin round and round

[chorus]
The Algorithm Song, it's never wrong
Numbers marching like a mechanical dawn
But when circuits hum and screens turn black
Fear takes over, can we turn back? 

[outro]
So here we stand on silicon sands
With borrowed time in mechanical hands
Sing the song before it's gone
This Algorithm Song.
