Request to Song Generating Agent:  
I want you to generate a song that captures the essence of a modern Romeo and Juliet story. The chorus should convey the idea of "Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo." Include lyrics about Juliet's father reading her text messages, which adds tension to their relationship. The singer should have a deep, soulful voice, and the vibe should hint at a past where the singer might have been an athlete, perhaps with some references to resilience or injury. For the music video concept, imagine two teenagers from separate buildings, one family being Jewish, which creates a cultural wedge between them. There’s lots of dancing in the video, so make sure the song has an upbeat, danceable rhythm at least in parts. Let’s create something emotional but also vibrant and full of movement!
