User : 
Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that captures a specific vibe. I need it to be soulful, with a male singer who has a powerful, emotive voiceâ€”think of someone like a white American singer from the 70s or 80s. The song should feature a harmonica playing a recurring melody that mirrors the chorus. 

The lyrics should include a part that goes something like "woooooooooow girl something something trouble with me noooow" and end with a reflective line about emptiness, maybe something like "have you ever seen such an empty ____." The overall mood should feel raw and emotional, with a touch of nostalgia.

Can you help me create something like this?

  [verse]
  Woooooooow girl something in your eyes
  Something I recognize
  Trouble with me now

  [chorus]
  Harmonica sings a song so sweet and low
  A mirror to my soul
  In this moment, we're whole

  [verse]
  Walking down these lonely streets at night
  Underneath the neon lights
  Searching for a sign

  [bridge]
  The world spins on without a care
  But I'm lost in thoughts of you everywhere

  [chorus]
  Harmonica sings a song so sweet and low
  A mirror to my soul
  In this moment, we're whole

  [ending]
  Have you ever seen such an empty room
  Echoes of our past, like ghosts in gloom
