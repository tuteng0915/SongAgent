Lyrics :
[Verse]
Out on the range where the wild winds blow
Horses run fast, man it's quite a show
Sunset skies paint the evening glow
In this land of dreams, hearts are bound to grow

[Chorus]
Saddle up cowboys, it's time to ride
With the stars above as our guide
Rodeo nights, under neon lights
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton, everything feels right

[Bridge]
Dust kicks up as we dance through the night
Laughter fills air, everything feels so right
Spurs jingle jangle, boots tapping tight
In this rodeo town, every moment’s a delight

[Outro]
Fast tempo beats, let’s line dance tonight
In cowboy boots, under starry light
