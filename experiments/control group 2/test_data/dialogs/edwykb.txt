Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a song for me that has a "carnival-esque" sound in the beginning. The intro should be lively and vibrant, but then the rest of the song should become rather low-key in comparison. The structure should feature an arpeggio that transitions into chords and then back to the arpeggio. Each chord should be accompanied by a drum hit. Can you generate such a song for me?

I have set up the song according to your preferences. The tags are "carnival, lively, vibrant, arpeggio, transition, chords, drum hit, low-key" and here are the lyrics:

[intro]
[arpeggio]

[verse]
Chords and drums together we go
Feeling the rhythm start to flow

[chorus]
Back to the arpeggio we fly
Music taking us through the sky

[bridge]
Let the beat drop, let it all fade
Feel the energy that we've made

[chorus]
Back to the arpeggio we soar
Lifting our spirits evermore

[outro]
[arpeggio]
