Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique request for you. I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of a track I vaguely remember. Here are the details:

- The song should have an atmospheric, almost ethereal quality, with a focus on vocals akin to an a capella style, complemented by subtle background music.
- It should be performed from the perspective of a female singer.
- The title must include the word "Rain," and it would be great if it could evoke a similar feeling to Joni Mitchell's work.
- Keep the duration relatively short, ideally under three minutes.

Could you create something based on these guidelines? Thank you! :)

I've set up the song based on your guidelines. The tags reflect an atmospheric and ethereal quality, with a focus on a capella-style female vocals, complemented by subtle background music. The title of the song includes "Rain" as requested, and the lyrics are inspired to evoke feelings similar to Joni Mitchell's work.

Here’s a preview of the lyrics I’ve generated:

**[verse]**
In the hush of twilight's glow
Whispers of the rain I know
Each droplet sings its ancient song
Secrets carried, deep and strong

**[chorus]**
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown

**[verse]**
Clouds converge in a dance so free
Veiling skies in their mystery
I hear your voice in every fall
A symphony where shadows call

**[chorus]**
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown

**[bridge]**
And when the world is dry and bare
I'll find the rain, it will still be there
Echoes linger, soft and warm
In every storm, there's a soothing calm

**[chorus]**
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown
