Request to the Song Generating Agent:

Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on some memories I have from my childhood. Here are the details: 

I remember listening to a slower-paced pop punk/emo rock song on my sister's iPod shuffle back in the early 2000s. The song started with the lyrics "Shackles and chains." The time period for this song would be around 1999 to 2005.

Can you generate a song that fits these criteria? It should have a nostalgic emo rock vibe, with the mentioned opening lyrics, and capture the essence of that era. Thank you!
