```
[verse]
Tears fall like rain from the sky,
Each one a memory, a silent goodbye.

[chorus]
In the silence, I hear your name,
A whisper carried by the wind's refrain.
Lost in this world of bittersweet pain,
Holding on to love, that forever remains.

[verse]
The night is long, stars hide their glow,
Moonlight kisses the tears that overflow.

[chorus]
In the silence, I hear your name,
A whisper carried by the wind's refrain.
Lost in this world of bittersweet pain,
Holding on to love, that forever remains.

[bridge]
Time may heal, but scars will stay,
In every shadow, in every shade.

[chorus]
In the silence, I hear your name,
A whisper carried by the wind's refrain.
Lost in this world of bittersweet pain,
Holding on to love, that forever remains.

[outro]
Echoes linger, as hearts mend,
In the quiet, our story never ends.
