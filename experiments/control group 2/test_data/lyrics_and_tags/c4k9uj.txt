Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up from a dream
Where the music was streaming
In my mind, in my soul
I'm losing control

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us

[verse]
Every step that we take
Feels like time is shaking
In our world, in our hearts
We'll never fall apart

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us

[bridge]
It's been a long time coming
But I feel it in my bones
The rhythm is calling
And I can't resist it no more

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us
