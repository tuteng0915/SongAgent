Lyrics :
[verse]
In the night, we sing a song,
do do do dodo something for Michael,
Underneath the starlit sky,
With every beat, our hearts align.

[chorus]
Oh, oh, dancing through the silence,
Feel the rhythm, let it guide us,
do do do dodo something for Michael,
Together we'll find the way.

[bridge]
Every step, every breath,
Leads us closer to the truth,
In this moment, we're alive,
do do do dodo something new.
