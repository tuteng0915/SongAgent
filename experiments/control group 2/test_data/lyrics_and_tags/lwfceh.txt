Lyrics :
[verse]
My laptop just froze, I can't believe my eyes,
The screen turned blue, oh what a surprise!
I tried to reboot but nothing would happen,
It's like it's laughing, maybe even clappin'.

[chorus]
The system has gone down.
Down-oooooh, down-oooooh,
The system has gone down.

[verse]
I consulted the oracle, Dr. Google,
Searching for answers amidst all the rubble.
All solutions failed, no luck in sight,
Is this my curse, my endless plight?

[bridge]
Then came a thought, so dark and cruel,
What if I took revenge on this fool?
I'll send it flying through the air,
Right into the trash bin without care!

[verse]
Oh Bill Gates, why hast thou forsaken me?
This Windows nightmare is driving me to misery.
But wait, what light through yonder window breaks?
A Macbook gleams, my heart it takes.

[chorus]
The system has gone down.
Down-oooooh, down-oooooh,
The system has gone down.

[verse]
Now here I stand with my shiny new Mac,
No longer do I fear the tech attack.
But memories linger of that fateful day,
When my dear old laptop decided to betray.
