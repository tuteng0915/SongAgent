Lyrics :
[verse]
In a room so bright, where shadows play,
I see your eyes in every shade of gray.
You're a mystery that I can't define,
A dangerous dance in the blink of time.

[chorus]
Oh, you're hypnotic, pulling me in,
Alluring whispers beneath your skin.
But there's danger lurking in your smile,
A fleeting moment, but worth the trial.

[verse]
Walking circles in this endless maze,
Your reflection haunts my dazed gaze.
With each step, I lose control,
Caught between desire and a treacherous soul.

[chorus]
Oh, you're hypnotic, pulling me in,
Alluring whispers beneath your skin.
But there's danger lurking in your smile,
A fleeting moment, but worth the trial.

[bridge]
The clones of me follow your lead,
In perfect sync, fulfilling a need.
Yet as they fade, I'm left alone,
Chasing echoes, in a world unknown.

[chorus]
Oh, you're hypnotic, pulling me in,
Alluring whispers beneath your skin.
But there's danger lurking in your smile,
A fleeting moment, but worth the trial.

[outro]
In this bright white space, our story ends,
A man in a suit, with light-colored lens.
But your memory lingers, like a sweet refrain,
Forever haunting, till we meet again.
