Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through fields of sugar cane
The sun beating down on my weary frame
I hear the echoes of simpler times
Of revolution and hope intertwined

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[verse]
Lying beneath the vast blue sky
Rustling leaves whisper as time goes by
Memories linger like sweet perfume
In the heart of Havana, where dreams resume

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[bridge]
Nostalgia grips me like an old friend
Taking me back to where it all began
Under the warmth of the Cuban sun
Where the battles were fought, but the war's not done

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[ending]
And so I wander through fields of green
Dreaming of what has been and what could've been
With every step, I feel the weight
Of history's path and love's freight
