Lyrics :
[verse]
freeeee, whoa oh
They dance like whispers in the silver beams

[chorus]
Oh, the world fades away
In this dreamscape I sway
With the moon as my guide
In this introspective ride

[verse]
Through the mirror of my mind, reflections gleam
A journey through the echoes, a lucid stream
Gets the best of me at nighttt

[chorus]
Oh, the world fades away
In this dreamscape I sway
With the moon as my guide
In this introspective ride

[bridge]
And if I fall, will I find
Solid ground or just time?
To wander these halls of thought
Till the morning light is caught
