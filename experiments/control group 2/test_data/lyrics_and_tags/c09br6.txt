Lyrics :
[verse]
Heart is pounding, feet are moving,
Sweat is pouring, no excuse in.
Pushing limits, breaking chains,
Feel the burn through all the veins.

[chorus]
DUDUDUDU MOONSHINE,
DUDUDUDU RAZOR LINE,
DUDUDUDU BREAK THE CHAINS,
DUDUDUDU FEEL THE PAIN.

[verse]
Muscles screaming, lungs on fire,
Still climbing higher and higher.
No surrender, no defeat,
Fuel the beast, feel the heat.

[bridge]
On the edge of the razor's blade,
Every step a choice we've made.
Chasing shadows, chasing dreams,
Pounding hearts and battle screams.

[chorus]
DUDUDUDU MOONSHINE,
DUDUDUDU RAZOR LINE,
DUDUDUDU BREAK THE CHAINS,
DUDUDUDU FEEL THE PAIN.

[outro]
When the night falls and the echoes call,
We'll rise again, never fall.
In the moonlight, we'll define,
The power found in every grind.
