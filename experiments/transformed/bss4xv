Hey, song generating agent! I need your help crafting a song based on some vivid details I have in mind. Here's what I'm looking for:

I want you to **generate an indie rock or emo rock-style song**—something raw and emotional with heartfelt lyrics. The tone should feel like it could’ve been released between 5 and 15 years ago, so think of that era's sound: guitar-driven melodies, angsty yet poetic.

The concept is this:  
- It’s sung from the perspective of a boyfriend who’s recounting the final words his girlfriend said to him as she died in his arms after a tragic accident.  
- To add complexity, the boyfriend feels overwhelming guilt because he believes the accident was his fault.  

For imagery, imagine a rainy night on a dimly lit street, surrounded by flashing police lights and medics trying to help but ultimately unable to save her. This scene plays out in the music video (if we were making one!).  

Can you create something hauntingly beautiful with these elements? Let me know the lyrics and tags when you're done!
