Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits the following description: it should have a classic rock vibe, possibly from the 80s or reminiscent of that era, with a mix of soft and rock-style vocals. The song should start with just a soft piano melody before building up into the full arrangement. Additionally, I’d love for the theme or lyrics to somehow involve water—whether it’s about oceans, rivers, rain, or even emotions tied to water. Let’s see what you can come up with!
