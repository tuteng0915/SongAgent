Lyrics :
[verse]
Strumming my guitar under a bright blue sky,
The rhythm's got me feeling so high,
Every note I play, it tells my story,
Of chasing dreams and catching glory.

[chorus]
Oh, the sky's so wide, endless and free,
Like a melody that carries me,
Through the highs and lows, I'll find my way,
With every chord and dream I play.

[verse]
Walking down this road with music in my soul,
Each strum takes me closer to my goal,
I see the world through sunglasses' hue,
Every shade of life feels brand new.

[chorus]
Oh, the sky's so wide, endless and free,
Like a melody that carries me,
Through the highs and lows, I'll find my way,
With every chord and dream I play.

[bridge]
In this journey, I've found my tune,
Underneath the watchful moon,
But it's the daylight that sets me free,
Bright blue skies are calling me.

[chorus]
Oh, the sky's so wide, endless and free,
Like a melody that carries me,
Through the highs and lows, I'll find my way,
With every chord and dream I play.
