Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the verses. Do you have any particular themes or ideas you'd like to explore in the verses?
Agent : 
That sounds great! To better tailor the song to your preferences, could you please share what themes or ideas you'd like to explore in the verses? For example, do you prefer something introspective and emotional, upbeat and energetic, or perhaps a narrative style that tells a story? Once I have a clearer idea, I can generate lyrics that fit your vision. 

If you're not sure, I can suggest some popular themes based on user preferences. Would you like me to do that?
