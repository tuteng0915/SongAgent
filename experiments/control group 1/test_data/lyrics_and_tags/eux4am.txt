Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the evening, beneath the starlit sky,
I found my heart in your eyes, where forever I would lie.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.

[verse]
Whispers of time fade away, as moments stand still,
Hand in hand, we walk this path, our hearts ready to fill.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.

[bridge]
And if the world should crumble down,
Our love will rise, above all sound.
Through storms and shadows, we'll never part,
Bound by the strings of a tender heart.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.
