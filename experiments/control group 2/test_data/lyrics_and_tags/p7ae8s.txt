Lyrics :
[verse]
Remember when the world stood still,
Dancing to a dial-up's shrill.
We had dreams and pixel dreams,
Living life inside our screens.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.

[verse]
Walking down these memory lanes,
Through the joys, the trends, the pains.
Neon lights on a discman glow,
Time was gold; it moved so slow.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.

[bridge]
So wear your sunscreen, chase the sun,
Let the nostalgia have its fun.
From chatrooms to mixtape cassettes,
Itâ€™s all within us, no regrets.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.
