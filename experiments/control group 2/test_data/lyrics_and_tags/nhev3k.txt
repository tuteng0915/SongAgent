Lyrics :
[intro]
<start quiet female vocal chops> dance... dance... dance... <end>

[verse 1]
We’re taking over, can’t you feel the vibe? 
Electric energy, we’re coming alive,
Lights are flashing, shadows on the floor,
The night is ours, let’s go explore.

[pre-chorus]
Get ready, get set, it’s about to go down,
Feel the rhythm take control now,

[chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, don’t stop the motion,
Feel the beat and let it pull you into devotion,
Hands up high, we’re breaking all emotion,
This is our moment, no need for composure!

[beat drop section]
<start faint female vocal in background> dance... dance... dance... <end>

[verse 2]
Every move we make feels like a spark,
In this electric storm, leaving its mark,
Together as one, the music ignites,
A symphony of colors burning through the night.

[chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, don’t stop the motion,
Feel the beat and let it pull you into devotion,
Hands up high, we’re breaking all emotion,
This is our moment, no need for composure!

[outro]
Dance… dance… just let it take control…
Fade out with soft synth echoes.
