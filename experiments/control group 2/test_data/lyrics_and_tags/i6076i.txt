Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been standing here in the shadows
Watching you shine, it's all I can do
You light up the room, but you don't even know my name
Stuck in this place where we're just friends again

[chorus]
But I'm more than a friend, can't you see?
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself

[verse]
Every laugh we share cuts deeper than before
It feels like I'm screaming, but you don't hear a sound
I write you letters that I'll never send
Hoping someday you'll see, this isn't how it ends

[chorus]
But I'm more than a friend, can't you see?
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself

[bridge]
If only you'd look closer, past the guard I hold tight
Maybe then you'd find the truth hiding beneath
But until that day, I'll wear this quiet pain
Smiling through the heartache, playing our same game

[chorus]
'Cause I'm more than a friend, can't you see?
Behind these eyes, there's so much more for you and me
But you keep walking by, like I'm invisible
Friendzoned under your spell, I'm losing myself

[outro]
So here's to us, stuck in this loop
Forever friends, while my heart breaks in two
