Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the main theme or message of the song. What do you want the song to convey?
Agent : 
Great! To better understand your preferences, could you please share what kind of themes or emotions you'd like the song to express? For example, is there a particular story, feeling, or message you have in mind? Additionally, do you prefer a certain style or genre for this song?

Agent : 
Certainly! Let's narrow down the details. What specific theme or emotion would you like the song to express? For instance, do you want it to be uplifting and energetic, or perhaps more introspective and mellow? Also, are there any particular genres or musical styles you're fond of, such as pop, rock, jazz, or classical?

Once I have this information, I can generate a song that aligns with your preferences.

Sure, let's go with a rock song that has an uplifting and energetic vibe. It should have a catchy chorus and include the lyrics "If only you knew, that you could." Can you also add a unique bass guitar riff in the pre-chorus? That would be great!

I've set up the tags and lyrics for your rock song with an uplifting and energetic vibe. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the morning light,
Felt the rush of the day taking flight.
Every step that I take, feels so right,
Living life with no time to fight.

[pre-chorus]
Bass riff here, setting the groove,
Feel the beat, let it prove.

[chorus]
If only you knew, that you could,
Change the world with all the good.
Rise above and break the hood,
If only you knew, that you could.

[verse]
Walking down the streets of hope and dreams,
Seeing visions in the moonlight beams.
With every heartbeat, the spirit gleams,
In this journey, nothingâ€™s as it seems.

[bridge]
Turn around, see the faces,
In the crowd, find your places.
Feel the power, hear the voices,
In this moment, everyone rejoices.

[chorus]
If only you knew, that you could,
Change the world with all the good.
Rise above and break the hood,
If only you knew, that you could.
```
