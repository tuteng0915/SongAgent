Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the world like a bull in a china shop,
Knocking things over without even a stop.
I didn't mean to cause a mess,
But now it's chaos and I'm loving the stress.

[chorus]
Oops, there goes another vase,
And I just knocked my coffee off its place.
The room’s spinning, everything’s a blur,
This is my life, ain’t it absurd?

[verse]
Every step I take leaves a trail of surprise,
Like dominoes falling before my eyes.
It's all fun and games till someone gets hit,
But who needs calm when you can live like this?

[bridge]
Crash! Bang! Boom!
Life's one big cartoon,
With every door I slam,
Another joke begins again.

[chorus]
Oops, there goes another vase,
And I just tripped on my own shoelace.
The room’s alive, it’s outta control,
But deep inside, I’ve found my soul.
