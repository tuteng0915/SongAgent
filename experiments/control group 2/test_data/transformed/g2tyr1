Hello, song agent! I'm looking to generate a song that captures a specific story and feeling. The song should include the lyric "Left a note by the door" and begin with a girl leaving home in a pickup truck without much notice. As the song progresses, it should recount her journey to fame and eventually reuniting with her parents. The style should evoke nostalgia, reminiscent of popular radio songs, with a touch of country despite me not being a big fan of the genre. Could you help me generate such a song?
