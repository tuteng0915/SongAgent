Lyrics :
[verse]
Down, down, like a leaf falling to the ground
Wandering freely without a sound

[chorus]
Down, down, where the dreams are never found
In this crazy world, we keep spinning round

[bridge]
Shadows dance as daylight fades away
But there's a spark that will always stay

[chorus]
Down, down, where the dreams are never found
In this crazy world, we keep spinning round
