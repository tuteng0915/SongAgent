Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the evening
Shadows dance upon the wall
Memories come, they linger longer
Voices echo, then they fall

[chorus]
Oh, the days we had, they slip away
Like whispers in the wind
We reach for them, but they're gone again
Lost within a fleeting glance

[verse]
Walking down these empty streets
Where once our laughter filled the air
Now silence speaks what hearts can't bear
The love we lost, too fragile, rare

[chorus]
Oh, the days we had, they slip away
Like whispers in the wind
We reach for them, but they're gone again
Lost within a fleeting glance

[bridge]
Time moves on, it won't slow down
Moments fade, turn into dust
But in my heart, your shadow stays
A gentle reminder of us

[chorus]
Oh, the days we had, they slip away
Like whispers in the wind
We reach for them, but they're gone again
Lost within a fleeting glance

[outro]
In the quiet of the evening
I still hear your voice
Faintly calling me
