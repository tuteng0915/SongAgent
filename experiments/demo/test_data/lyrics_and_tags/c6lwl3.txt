Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
She takes his hand and takes him up the stairs
Whispers of dreams dangling just out of reach
Innocence cloaked in the twilight air
A world of promises none could teach

[Chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, we dance in stolen time
The weight of expectations, shadows on the wall
We chase the echoes of who we used to be
Falling through the cracks of reality

[Verse 2]
Reflections shimmer in the fading light
The disillusionment of growing older
Laughter and tears under starless nights
The innocence of youth, a fleeting shoulder

[Chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, we dance in stolen time
The weight of expectations, shadows on the wall
We chase the echoes of who we used to be
Falling through the cracks of reality

[Bridge]
Oh, how the moments slip away
Like sand through fingers, they never stay
The mirror shows a face not our own
A reminder of paths walked, yet overgrown

[Chorus]
Hips pressed into mine, we dance in stolen time
The weight of expectations, shadows on the wall
We chase the echoes of who we used to be
Falling through the cracks of reality
