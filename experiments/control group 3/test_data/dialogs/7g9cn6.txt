I'm ready to help create that song for you. To start, could you give me a bit more detail about the spoken-word intro? What specific emotions or phrases would you like to capture?
Agent : 
Sure, let's break it down. Could you share some key phrases or ideas that you'd like to be included in the spoken-word intro? Additionally, what kind of emotions should the intro convey—should it be reflective, energetic, mysterious, or something else? This will help shape both the lyrics and the overall vibe of the song.
User : 
The spoken-word intro should convey raw emotions, like anger and betrayal. Phrases like "You had one job!" or "I gave you everything..." would be great. It should feel intense and a bit chaotic, reflecting the pain of being betrayed.

I've crafted a song structure with your specified spoken-word intro that conveys raw emotions of anger and betrayal. The lyrics are intense and chaotic, reflecting the pain of being betrayed. Here's a preview:

- **Spoken-word Intro:**  
  "You had one job! I gave you everything..."

- **Verse 1:**  
  Walking down these streets alone,  
  Thought you were my friend, but I've grown.  
  All the trust I've thrown your way,  
  Now it's gone, and I'm astray.

- **Chorus:**  
  The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,  
  A bond broken, no place to hide.  
  Once we stood, now we fall apart,  
  Your betrayal strikes right through my heart.

- **Verse 2 & Bridge:** Continue with similar themes...

 [spoken-word intro]
You had one job!
I gave you everything...

[verse 1]
Walking down these streets alone,
Thought you were my friend, but I've grown.
All the trust I've thrown your way,
Now it's gone, and I'm astray.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
A bond broken, no place to hide.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Your betrayal strikes right through my heart.

[verse 2]
Every word you said was a lie,
Underneath the stars, I wonder why.
Together we laughed, together we cried,
But now I see through your disguise.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
A bond broken, no place to hide.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Your betrayal strikes right through my heart.

[bridge]
Maybe someday I'll find peace again,
Until then, let this wound mend.
For now, I'll carry this scar,
A reminder of just who you are.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
A bond broken, no place to hide.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Your betrayal strikes right through my heart.

The spoken-word intro and the overall vibe are good, but could we add a bit more reclaiming power in the chorus? Something that shows resilience.

This change emphasizes reclaiming power and finding inner strength despite the pain.
