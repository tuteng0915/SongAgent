Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on the following idea: 

It should be an alternative rock song with a male vocalist. The core theme is about the frustration of people pretending to understand what someone else is going through, even though they really can’t. The lyrics should revolve around the idea of "You don't know what it's like to be me, so you can’t say anything." 

The song should build up tension throughout and end with a punchline where the singer admits something like, "And I don’t know what it’s like to be you either," followed by the music abruptly cutting off, leaving the listener with a strong sense of finality.

Can you generate that for me?

I've generated the song based on your idea. Here are the sections of the lyrics:

[verse]
You nod your head like you get it all
But the words just bounce off the wall
I can see it in your eyes, you don't know what it's like
To walk this road alone

[chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[verse]
The silence screams louder than words ever could
Your advice feels more like nails in the wood
Every syllable cuts deep but misses the mark
'Cause empathy's a language we've lost in the dark

[chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[bridge]
It builds and builds, no release in sight
The pressure grows with every lie
You think you're helping, but you're breaking the seal
And I'm drowning in feelings I can't reveal

[final chorus]
You don't know what it's like to be me
No, you can't say anything
You don't feel my pain, you don't carry my weight
So don't pretend you understand

[punchline]
And I don't know what it's like... to be you either

[ending]
