I'd like you to generate a song based on the following details: It should be in the pop genre with a moderately paced, groovy, and chill vibe. The singer should be female, and the chorus needs to include the lyrics "ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow". Keep the overall tone engaging but laid-back. Let's create something that could easily be mistaken for a hit song I might hear during a workout!

Lyrics:
```
[verse]
Walking down the street, feeling that beat
Every step I take, my worries abate
In this moment, life is so sweet
Got my headphones on, hear the music play

[chorus]
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Dancing through the night, letting my spirits flow
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Gonna keep it up, riding that tempo

[bridge]
Underneath the neon lights, everything feels right
I'm losing track of time, just moving with the vibe
There ain't no place I'd rather be, yeah, you feel me?
Just a soul on the loose, caught up in the groove
```

Please press the "generate" button to manually generate the song. Enjoy your new hit workout track!

The tags and lyrics look great, but I think we could add a little more "Trap" influence to the vibe. Could you tweak that for me?

I've added a "trap influence" to the tags, which should give the song a bit more of that modern edge while maintaining its laid-back and groovy feel. Here are the updated tags:

Tags: pop, moderately paced, groovy, chill, female singer, engaging, laid-back, trap influence

The lyrics will remain the same. Please press the "generate" button again to apply these changes and create your updated track. Enjoy the new vibe!

Perfect, I think we've got it just right. The added "Trap" influence is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for helping me create this catchy and engaging track! If I need any more songs in the future, I'll be sure to ask. For now, let's call this project complete.
