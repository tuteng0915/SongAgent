Sure, that sounds like a compelling story. Let's start by focusing on the general vibe and genre of the song. Do you have any preferences in mind?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
I see, we haven't honed in on a specific vibe or genre yet. To create the most engaging song, could you share your thoughts on the mood, style, or any particular elements you'd like to include? For example, are you leaning towards something more upbeat and energetic, or perhaps something slower and introspective? Any artists or songs that inspire you could also be helpful.
User : 
Well, I'm not really into specific genres or artists. I just want it to be really catchy but also have a soft side to it. Maybe something that feels modern but still has a classic touch. Does that make sense?
Agent : 
Absolutely, I understand what you're aiming for â€” a balance between catchy and soft, with a modern yet classic feel. To capture this essence, I'll suggest some tags that align with your vision. Then, I'll draft the lyrics accordingly.

Let's set the following tags: "catchy, soft, modern, classic, melodic, emotional". 

Now, let me generate the initial draft of the lyrics.

Great! With the tags set, let's move on to drafting the lyrics. I'll create a structure with verses, choruses, and a bridge to give the song a coherent flow.

[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I find my dreams take flight,
A gentle breeze, a whisper soft,
Carries me above the loft.

[chorus]
Oh, we dance under stars so bright,
Caught between the dark and light,
With every step, a melody unfolds,
A story written in the folds.

[verse]
Through crowded streets and empty halls,
Echoes bounce off ancient walls,
The rhythm of life, a ticking clock,
Yet in stillness, time seems to mock.

[chorus]
Oh, we dance under stars so bright,
Caught between the dark and light,
With every heartbeat, feelings grow bold,
A tapestry woven in gold.

[bridge]
And when the night fades to gray,
Hold onto dreams that never sway,
For love will guide through shadows deep,
Awakening whispers from sleep.

[chorus]
Oh, we dance under stars so bright,
Caught between the dark and light,
Hand in hand, where futures are told,
A timeless journey, forever bold.
