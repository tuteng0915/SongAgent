Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night's embrace,
Shadows dance with the moon's soft grace.
Whispers call from the dark expanse,
A mystery woven in the starlit trance.
Children in Victorian dress, afloat they glide,
Rowed gently down a river wide.

[chorus]
Oh, ancient echoes gently colliding,
Voices of the unseen softly residing.
Beneath the celestial sky so vast,
Secrets linger, shadows cast.

[verse]
Through veils of twilight's gentle descent,
Dreams awaken where none have ventured.
Surreal landscapes painted in hues,
Of a haunting beauty that time can't refuse.
Atop a hill, a mansion stands deserted,
With remnants of a party long since skirted.

[chorus]
Oh, ancient echoes gently colliding,
Voices of the unseen softly residing.
Beneath the celestial sky so vast,
Secrets linger, shadows cast.

[bridge]
Amongst the whispers, a chant begins,
Soft yet commanding, it stirs within.
Ethereal threads in a tapestry grand,
A night's tale told across the land.
