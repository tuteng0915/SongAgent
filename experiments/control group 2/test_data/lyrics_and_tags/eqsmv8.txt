Lyrics :
[verse]
I remember the static in our hearts 
A melody of longing, tearing us apart
Every note a memory, every word a scar
In this symphony of ours, under the same stars

[chorus]
Oh, how we danced to songs unsung
Our shadows long where we belong
Lost in echoes, where love begun
Chasing dreams through the setting sun

[verse 2]
You took my hand beneath the moonlit sky
We laughed like children with no reason why
Through city lights and whispers in the dark
Together we painted our own spark

[bridge]
And then you walked me home that night
Opened the gate, everything felt right
Took me to the doorstep, kissed me sweet and slow
In that moment, I think I came to know

[storytelling section]
She smiled as she fumbled for her keys
Her laughter filling up the evening breeze
"Goodnight," she said, but I stayed awhile
Memorizing her face, her style, her smile

[acoustic outro]
The world stood still in that tender embrace
Just two souls finding their sacred place
The night was young, but it felt so complete
As our hearts synced to a rhythm so sweet
