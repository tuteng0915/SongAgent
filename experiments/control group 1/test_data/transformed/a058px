Hey there! I’d like you to generate a pop song that features trumpets, but they only appear in certain parts of the song—maybe not the chorus, I'm not sure. The song should have an upbeat vibe with a female singer who has a mid-range voice—not too high-pitched. It would fit perfectly in a rom-com scene where couples are dancing or in a lively commercial. The trumpet riff should repeat in three sets of four repetitions: the first two sets sounding similar and the last set being different. Can you work your magic and create something like that?
