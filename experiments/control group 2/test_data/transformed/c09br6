Hey there! I’m looking to generate a high-energy rock song that gets you pumped up—perfect for an intense workout. The chorus should have a chant-like vibe with lyrics something like, "DUDUDUDU MOONSHINE, DUDUDUDU FINE WINE" (though the "fine wine" part can be swapped out for something else that fits better). The overall feel of the song needs to be powerful and adrenaline-pumping, with strong guitar riffs and a driving beat. Let’s create this beast of a track!
