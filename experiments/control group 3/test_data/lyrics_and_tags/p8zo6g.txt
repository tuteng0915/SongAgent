Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows, I reach for the light,
A heart full of dreams in the dead of night.
Every echo calls me to be free,
Yearning for a world where I can see.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.

[verse]
Through the storm, we forge our path,
With every step, we redraw the map.
Eyes on the horizon, we're drawn to the flame,
Desires unspoken, yet none are the same.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.

[bridge]
The road is long, but we won't tire,
Fueled by passion, driven by fire.
Together we stand, forever we'll climb,
Reaching for glory, one more time.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.
