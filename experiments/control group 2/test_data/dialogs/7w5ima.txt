Hey there! I understand you're looking for a song, but how about we create one instead? Based on your description, it sounds like you're after a powerful metal/rock track with clean vocals and an emotionally charged chorus. The vibe seems to align with bands like Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and Linkin Park—bands known for their heavy yet melodic sound.

Here’s my request:  
Can you generate a metal/rock song with clean vocals that has a chorus centered around themes of desperation or longing? Something along the lines of "Rescue me... [forgotten lyrics] ...I'm drowning." The tone should be intense and emotional, capturing that same heaviness found in alternative/nu-metal styles. Let's make it epic!

What do you think?

[verse]
I've been lost in the shadows
Falling deeper every day
The weight of this world's too heavy
There's no light to lead the way

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning
Caught inside this endless fight
Bring me back to life again
Before I fade into the night

[verse 2]
Silent cries echo louder
A soul on fire, burning cold
No escape from these chains that bind me
In this void, I've lost control

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning
Caught inside this endless fight
Bring me back to life again
Before I fade into the night

[bridge]
The clock is ticking faster now
Every breath feels like my last
Will you pull me through before it's over?
Or am I destined to be past
```

This track should feel intense and emotional, capturing that heaviness found in alternative/nu-metal styles while keeping the melody epic and engaging.
