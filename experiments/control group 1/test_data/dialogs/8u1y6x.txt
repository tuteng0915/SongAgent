I'd like a song with a male singer, an upbeat tempo, and a specific lyric about windows or wind. Can you work on that?

I've crafted a song with a male singer and an upbeat tempo, incorporating themes of windows and wind as you requested. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
I feel the wind in my hair,
Racing through the open air.
Windows down on a sunny day,
Driving away, far away.

[chorus]
The wind is calling, setting me free,
Windows open wide to eternity.
Every road leads to somewhere new,
With the wind and windows, life feels so true.
