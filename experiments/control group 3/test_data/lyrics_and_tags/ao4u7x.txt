Lyrics :
[verse]
Diving deep into the blue,
Where light fades and dreams ensue.

Floating here in silence deep,
In this world where secrets sleep.

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call,
Underwater walls.
Lost among the bubbles,
In this ocean of troubles.

[verse]
Weightless in a liquid embrace,
Time slows down, leaves no trace.

[bridge]
Surface far above,
Here, where shadows love.

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call,
Underwater walls.
Lost among the bubbles,
In this ocean of troubles.

[outro]
Rising slowly to the sky,
Leaving depths where dreams comply.
