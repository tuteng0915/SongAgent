I want a song that sounds like Lincoln Park, can you do that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create a song that captures the essence of Linkin Park. To make it more personalized, could you please provide me with some additional details? Such as:

1. The theme or message you want the lyrics to convey.
2. Any specific emotions or vibes you want the song to evoke.
3. If you have any preference for the structure of the song (like verses, chorus, bridge, etc.).

With this information, I'll be able to craft something that aligns well with your vision.
User : 
The theme should be about addiction, you know, something deep. And no need for the structure, just make it flow.
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.

I've crafted a song inspired by Linkin Park with the theme of addiction. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Caught in the haze of yesterday's high
Chasing shadows, losing the light

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all

[verse]
Falling deeper into the void
Searching for a way to rewind

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all

[bridge]
The chains that bind me, they're invisible
A war inside, my personal hell

[chorus]
Can't break free, it's pulling me down
Addiction's sweet song, a never-ending round
In the silence, I hear its call
Lost within myself, I'm nothing at all
```

Please press the "generate" button when you're ready to create the song.
User : 
That's heavy, but I like it. Can we add some sound effects at the beginning and end? You know, something rhythmic.
Agent : 
Sure thing! We can extend the song at both the beginning and end to include rhythmic sound effects that will complement the track. Let's add 10 seconds at the start and 10 seconds at the end for these effects.

I'll go ahead and make those adjustments.


this tool is currently not available
It seems that the tool to extend the song is currently not available. However, I can still suggest adding rhythmic sound effects during the production phase once the song is generated.

Would you like to proceed with generating the song now, and handle the sound effects addition in post-production? If so, please press the "generate" button to create the song.
User : 
Yeah, let's do that. Let's generate the song and I'll add the effects later.
Agent : 
Great! Please press the "generate" button to create your song. Once it's generated, you can add the rhythmic sound effects in post-production. If you need any further assistance with editing or anything else, feel free to ask. Enjoy your music creation process!
