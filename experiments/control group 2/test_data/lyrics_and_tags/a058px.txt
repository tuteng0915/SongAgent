Lyrics :
[verse]
We're dancing through the night
Under neon skies so bright
Every step, every move
Feels like we're in a dream

[chorus]
Oh, let's keep this moment alive
In our hearts, we'll never divide
Together we can touch the sky
Feel the rhythm take us high

[verse]
Our laughter fills the air
As couples twirl without a care
The music leads the way
In this perfect scene today

[chorus]
Oh, let's keep this moment alive
In our hearts, we'll never divide
Together we can touch the sky
Feel the rhythm take us high

[bridge]
Trumpets sound, they call to me
A melody of destiny
In three sets, they brightly ring
A pattern that makes my heart sing

[chorus]
Oh, let's keep this moment alive
In our hearts, we'll never divide
Together we can touch the sky
Feel the rhythm take us high

[outro]
The night is young, we've got time
To live within this sweet rhyme
Let's dance until the morning light
And hold on to this endless night
