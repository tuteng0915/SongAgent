User : 
I want a song that's acoustic and has an 80s rock style. It should be about overcoming challenges and resilience, sung by a male vocalist. Can you start with that?

Sure, I can start with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular themes or messages you want to be included in the lyrics? For instance, do you want it to reflect personal growth, unity, or perhaps a specific challenge like recovering from a setback? Also, do you have a preference for the song's structure, such as the number of verses and choruses?
User : 
The song should reflect facing tough times and pushing through with determination. I don't have a specific structure in mind, so you can decide that. Can you show me some lyrics now?

I have set the tags for your song to reflect an acoustic and 80s rock style with themes of overcoming challenges and resilience, performed by a male vocalist. Here are the lyrics I've drafted:

[verse]
In the shadows of the unknown,
A heart beats strong, alone.
Facing storms with steadfast pace,
Carving courage through the pain.

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky,
Dreams unbroken, spirits high.
Through the fire, we'll never fade,
With every step, our fears betrayed.

[verse]
Mountains crumble, rivers dry,
Yet hope endures where dreams comply.
With each dawn, a chance anew,
To face the world with strength and truth.

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky,
Dreams unbroken, spirits high.
Through the fire, we'll never fade,
With every step, our fears betrayed.

[bridge]
Hold on tight to who you are,
Guided by the northern star.
In the silence, hear your call,
Stand unbowed, never fall.

The lyrics and tags look great, but I think it needs a bit more emotion in the bridge. Can you tweak that part to make it more heartfelt?

I've revised the bridge section of the lyrics to evoke more emotion and heartfelt sentiment. Here's the updated version:

[bridge]
In the quiet, find your voice,
A single tear, a world of choice.
Hold on tight to love and grace,
Feel the warmth, find your place.
