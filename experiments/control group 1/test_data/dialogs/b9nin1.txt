I understand you want a song with a unique vocal style and a specific type of chorus. Could you tell me more about the theme or message you'd like the lyrics to convey?

Sure! To better understand your vision, could you specify the main theme or emotion you want the song to express? For example, is there a particular story, feeling, or message you'd like the lyrics to focus on? This will help me tailor the song more accurately to your preferences. Once I have this information, I'll generate the initial tags and lyrics for your song.
