I need a song that captures a haunting yet beautiful mood with ethereal, low, droning instrumentals. Can you work with that?

Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular themes or emotions you want the lyrics to convey? Also, do you have a preferred length or structure for the song?
User : 
The theme should be cinematic and set at night, with surreal and mysterious visuals. The length and structure don't matter much to me. Can you add some female vocals that are soft but commanding, like a chant?

I've crafted a song structure with your specified themes and added lyrics that should resonate with the cinematic, surreal night you're envisioning. The tags have been set to include haunting, beautiful, ethereal qualities along with low droning instrumentals, and female vocals that resemble a chant.

Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
In the heart of the night's embrace,
Shadows dance with the moon's soft grace.
Whispers call from the dark expanse,
A mystery woven in the starlit trance.

[chorus]
Oh, ancient echoes gently colliding,
Voices of the unseen softly residing.
Beneath the celestial sky so vast,
Secrets linger, shadows cast.

[verse]
Through veils of twilight's gentle descent,
Dreams awaken where none have ventured.
Surreal landscapes painted in hues,
Of a haunting beauty that time can't refuse.

[chorus]
Oh, ancient echoes gently colliding,
Voices of the unseen softly residing.
Beneath the celestial sky so vast,
Secrets linger, shadows cast.

[bridge]
Amongst the whispers, a chant begins,
Soft yet commanding, it stirs within.
Ethereal threads in a tapestry grand,
A night's tale told across the land.

The lyrics and the tags look great, but I was thinking, could we add some specific imagery? Like children in Victorian clothing being rowed down a river and a scene with a deserted mansion filled with remnants of a party? It's not crucial, but it would be nice.

I've updated the lyrics to include the imagery of children in Victorian clothing being rowed down a river and a scene with a deserted mansion filled with remnants of a party. Here's how the new verses look:

[verse]
In the heart of the night's embrace,
Shadows dance with the moon's soft grace.
Whispers call from the dark expanse,
A mystery woven in the starlit trance.
Children in Victorian dress, afloat they glide,
Rowed gently down a river wide.

[verse]
Through veils of twilight's gentle descent,
Dreams awaken where none have ventured.
Surreal landscapes painted in hues,
Of a haunting beauty that time can't refuse.
Atop a hill, a mansion stands deserted,
With remnants of a party long since skirted.

The rest of the song remains the same. Press the "generate" button once more to hear the updated version with these vivid images woven into the narrative.
