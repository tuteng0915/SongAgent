Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of chaos, chaos
A white lie, a white lie spoken in vain
Riding on the edge of a white line, white line

[chorus]
White noise drowns out the pain, the pain
In a world gone mad, mad with desire
Chaos, chaos reigns over the sane
We're all living a white lie, white lie

[bridge]
Through the storm of static, static and fear
Truth is but a whisper, lost in the white noise, white noise

[chorus]
White noise drowns out the pain, the pain
In a world gone mad, mad with desire
Chaos, chaos reigns over the sane
We're all living a white lie, white lie
