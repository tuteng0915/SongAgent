Hmm, it seems like we need to specify more details. Let's tell the agent that we want a song with an 80s or early 90s feel, something upbeat and danceable, with a touch of disco. And don't forget those lyrics!

It looks like we need to clarify the lyrics we want. Let's mention that we're thinking of a chorus that goes "you’ve got to break (pause) through." That should help guide the song generation!

We should also clarify the structure of the song. Can we have a chorus that includes "you’ve got to break (pause) through"? That line is key to getting the right feel!

I think we need to be more specific about the lyrics. Let's ask for a chorus that starts with "you’ve got to break (pause) through." That should help steer the song in the right direction!
