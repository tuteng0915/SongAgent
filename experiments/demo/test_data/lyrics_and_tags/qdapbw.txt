Lyrics :
[verse]
Awakening to skies so bright,
A world reborn in morning light.
Each step we take, a path unknown,
Yet courage calls us, not alone.

[chorus]
Down, down, reaching out for the dreams that inspire,
Rise again, let hearts ignite,
With dreams that guide us through the night.
Together we can touch the sky,
In this journey, we will fly.

[verse]
Whispers of change on the winds that sing,
Promises made to the hopeful spring.
Hand in hand, we brave the storm,
In unity, we are reborn.

[chorus]
Down, down, diving deep where the shadows expire,
Rise again, let hearts ignite,
With dreams that guide us through the night.
Together we can touch the sky,
In this journey, we will fly.

[bridge]
Every moment, a chance to grow,
In the tapestry of life, we sew.
Threads of sorrow, strands of joy,
All woven into one grand story.

[chorus]
Down, down, feeling roots as we climb ever higher,
Rise again, let hearts ignite,
With dreams that guide us through the night.
Together we can touch the sky,
In this journey, we will fly.
