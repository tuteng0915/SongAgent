User : 
I want a song with a moody atmosphere, repetitive beat, and themes of resilience and defiance. It should have a cinematic vibe, like the movie *Drive*. Can you start with that?

  [verse]
  In the shadows, I rise again
  Through the dark, my heart's a weapon
  [chorus]
  I won't back down, no retreat
  This is my fight, my heartbeat
  [verse]
  The night whispers secrets untold
  But I walk this path, brave and bold
  [chorus]
  I won't back down, no retreat
  This is my fight, my heartbeat
  [bridge]
  Defy the world, break the chain
  In this moment, I'll feel no pain
  [chorus]
  I won't back down, no retreat
  This is my fight, my heartbeat
  ```
