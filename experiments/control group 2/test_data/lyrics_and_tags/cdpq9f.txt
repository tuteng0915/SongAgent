Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of her lab, she studies bones
The echoes whisper secrets only she could own
With headphones on, she finds her peace
And in this solitude, her spirit's released

[chorus]
They put me in a box / They tried to put me in a box
But my heart won't conform, it just softly mocks
This mellow love that flows, like an undercurrent strong
Beneath the surface, where I truly belong

[verse]
Her world is built from fragments of the past
Each piece a story that forever will last
She listens close, to songs that understand
Melancholy melodies played by a tender hand

[chorus]
They put me in a box / They tried to put me in a box
But my soul won't be caged, it's gently unlocked
By love so profound, yet delicately soft
In these moments alone, I am love, aloft

[bridge]
Underneath the stars, with music as our guide
We dance through life's mysteries, side by side
Our hearts entwined within this cosmic sea
Two souls adrift, yet perfectly free

[chorus]
They put me in a box / They tried to put me in a box
Yet here I stand unbroken, my spirit never stops
For love has set me free, from all they thought was mine
In this mellow tune, our destinies intertwine
