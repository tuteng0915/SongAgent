Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that captures a specific vibe. I need it to be soulful, with a male singer who has a powerful, emotive voiceâ€”think of someone like a white American singer from the 70s or 80s. The song should feature a harmonica playing a recurring melody that mirrors the chorus. 

The lyrics should include a part that goes something like "woooooooooow girl something something trouble with me noooow" and end with a reflective line about emptiness, maybe something like "have you ever seen such an empty ____." The overall mood should feel raw and emotional, with a touch of nostalgia.

Can you help me create something like this?
