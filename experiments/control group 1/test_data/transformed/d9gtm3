Hey there! I've got this song idea that's been floating around in my head, and I'd love for you to help me generate it. Here’s what I’m thinking:

- The song should have a synth intro that sets the tune.
- It should include lyrics with the phrases "I know you’re a dreamer" and "Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to lose."
- After the line "nothing left to lose," there should be a little guitar riff, followed by a rhyming line.
- The style should feel like it could be from a British band, with a definite singer-songwriter vibe.

Can you help me create a song based on these elements? Cheers!
