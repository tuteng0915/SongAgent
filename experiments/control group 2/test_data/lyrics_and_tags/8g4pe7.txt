Lyrics :
[intro]
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana

[verse 1]
Walking down these old streets I've known
Where shadows dance and the memories have grown
Every corner holds a piece of my past
Whispers linger long after they've passed

[chorus]
Oh, take me back to the days gone by
When nights were young and dreams would fly
Underneath the moonlit sky so wide
Together we'll ride that endless tide

[verse 2]
In this quiet town where echoes remain
The stories of love and loss intertwine again
Footsteps echo on cobblestones worn
Each one a memory waiting to be reborn

[chorus]
Oh, take me back to the days gone by
When nights were young and dreams would fly
Underneath the moonlit sky so wide
Together we'll ride that endless tide

[bridge]
And though the years may change our views
Some things remain, their charm still true
A melody played in the heart of night
Brings us closer to those distant lights

[chorus]
Oh, take me back to the days gone by
When nights were young and dreams would fly
Underneath the moonlit sky so wide
Together we'll ride that endless tide

[outro]
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana
