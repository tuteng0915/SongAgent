Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches some specific details. Here's what I'm looking for:

I want a pop punk song with an ascending melody in the chorus, and it should have a bit of a whiney tone to it—something that feels emotionally raw. The key lyric I’m imagining is something like **"gonna leave me here on my own"**, which should be central to the chorus. Keep it punchy and energetic, but also reflective of classic pop punk vibes.

Can you create something based on these requirements?
