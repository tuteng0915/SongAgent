Lyrics :
[Intro]
 catchy guitar riff

[Verse 1]
Walking down these halls, we've been friends through it all,
Dreams as big as the sky, reaching out so high.

[Chorus]
Together we'll chase every dream,
In this wild, crazy teenage scene.
With our hearts on fire, we'll never tire,
Of chasing stars until they're ours.

[Verse 2]
Late night talks and plans made under moonlit skies,
Our friendship's bond that never fades, it never dies.

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, let's make memories to last forever,
Oh, oh-oh, in this journey we call life together.

[Chorus]
Together we'll chase every dream,
In this wild, crazy teenage scene.
With our hearts on fire, we'll never tire,
Of chasing stars until they're ours.

[Outro]
So here's to us, to now, to everlasting trust,
And to those dreams ahead, shining bright, not yet bled.
