Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the morning light,
Socks on, ready for the fight.
Mirror shows a dancer's face,
In every move, I find my place.

[chorus]
On the stage or all alone,
Every step is my own throne.
Though the world might not understand,
I speak loudest with my hands.

[verse]
After class, words cut so deep,
But in silence, secrets keep.
Alone on this playground spin,
While others stand like mannequins.

[chorus]
On the stage or all alone,
Every step is my own throne.
Though the world might not understand,
I speak loudest with my hands.

[bridge]
Through disappointment grows the fire,
Dancing higher, taking it higher.
In every shadowed corner found,
A brighter light, a softer sound.

[chorus]
On the stage or all alone,
Every step is my own throne.
Though the world might not understand,
I speak loudest with my hands.
