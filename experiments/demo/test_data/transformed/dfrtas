Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits the following description: It’s a rock song with a male vocalist, themed perfectly for Halloween. The structure of the lyrics should go through every letter of the alphabet, describing how different people meet their demise in a darkly humorous way (e.g., "J is for Janice who died in a well"). Additionally, the song should open with a sample inspired by *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. Let’s create something eerie, creative, and fun for my Halloween playlist!
