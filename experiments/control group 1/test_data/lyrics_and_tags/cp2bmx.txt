Lyrics :
[verse]
In the mirror, I see a soul divided
A heart once whole, now broken and decided
Each scar a story, each tear a verse
I navigate this labyrinth, my path perverse

[chorus]
Lost in thoughts, shadows dance on my mind
Echoes of laughter from times left behind
Searching for solace where none can be found
Building my castle on ever-shifting ground

[verse]
Words unspoken linger in the air
Dreams deferred float like a silent prayer
Hope flickers dimly through the cracks
As night turns to day, I wear my mask

[bridge]
But within me burns an undying flame
A call to rise, to fight, to stake my claim
For every moment lost, there's one yet to gain
With every drop of pain, comes a touch of rain

[chorus]
Lost in thoughts, shadows dance on my mind
Echoes of laughter from times left behind
Searching for solace where none can be found
Building my castle on ever-shifting ground
