Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been searching for a love that's true
Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you
Through the highs and the lows, through the wrongs and rights
Your laughter's my favorite sound in the night

[chorus]
Girlfriend, you're my shining star
Girlfriend, no matter who you are
With every breath, with all my heart
Girlfriend, you set my world apart

[verse 2]
We can run away, leave it all behind
Feel the rush of youth, we can redefine
The lines that once held us, they don't exist
Together we'll make our own twist

[chorus]
Girlfriend, you're my wildest dream
Girlfriend, you're my everything
Hand in hand, let's light the spark
Girlfriend, you leave your mark

[bridge]
The thunder roars, but we stand tall
In this crazy world, you're my all-in-all
No looking back, only moving ahead
With you by my side, thereâ€™s no room for dread

[chorus]
Girlfriend, brighter than the moon
Girlfriend, changing like a tune
Forever yours, till the end of time
Girlfriend, life is so sublime
