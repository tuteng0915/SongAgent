Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song for me. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should be a rap song where the speaker reflects on a past relationship, expressing regret and longing. They admit their mistakes and convey a deep desire to reconcile, making it seem like they’re talking about an ex-girlfriend. However, the twist comes in the final line, which reveals the song is actually about their deceased father—something like “I can’t believe you died, dad.” This revelation should hit hard, giving listeners that shocking moment that makes them want to revisit the lyrics with this new context.  

Let’s go with a raw, emotional tone throughout, blending introspective verses with a powerful beat drop before the last line. Think moody instrumentals, maybe some somber piano mixed with trap beats.  

Can you work your magic and create something based on this idea?
