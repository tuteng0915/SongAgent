Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some specific ideas I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want it to be a pop or R&B style song, with a vibe that feels like it could’ve been released anytime from the 90s through the 2000s—or even more recently. It should feel mellow and laid-back, the kind of track you’d hear while chilling at a café or browsing through aisles at the store.

The lead vocalist should be female (or part of a girl group), and the chorus needs to evoke something warm and reflective. Maybe the hook starts with lines like:  
- "The one I’m missing is you"  
- "The only reason is you"  

Or perhaps something where the last word rhymes with “you,” like “do” or “true.” To add texture, I’d love for there to be backing vocals—other female voices—that sing softly in the background, either repeating “yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah” slowly or just vocalizing harmonies without words. That section should sound really soothing and dreamy.

For instrumentation, I’d like an unexpected touch—a xylophone, marimba, kalimba, or something similar. Something delicate but distinctive that adds a unique layer to the melody. Overall, the tempo should stay relaxed, making it easy listening but still emotionally resonant.

Think you can whip up something like this? Let me know how it turns out!

[verse]  
Walking down the avenue  
Thinking 'bout the things we used to do  
Every step feels so brand new  
But it's you I'm missing, it's you  

[chorus]  
The one I'm missing is you  
The only reason is you  
In every moment, in all I do  
It’s always been you, yeah true  

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[verse]  
Memories linger like a sweet perfume  
Traces of us are everywhere in this room  
And though you're gone, your light shines through  
And it's you I'm dreaming of, it's you  

[chorus]  
The one I'm missing is you  
The only reason is you  
In every heartbeat, in all I knew  
It’s always been you, nothing but true  

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[bridge]  
Soft whispers in the night  
Moonlight dancing on water bright  
Dreams carrying me back to you  
In colors rich and skies so blue  

[chorus]  
The one I'm missing is you  
The only reason is you  
Through every season, there’s no-one new  
It’s always been you, just me and you  

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[outro]  
And as the stars shine above  
I’ll keep singing my song of love  
For you... yes, for you…  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
