I'm ready to help create your song. Could you tell me more about the characters involved?
Agent : 
Sure! To better understand your vision, could you please provide some details about the characters you have in mind for this song? For instance, are they human, mythical creatures, or perhaps personified objects? What are their stories, emotions, or conflicts that you'd like to express through the lyrics? This will help tailor the song to fit your creative needs.
