Hey there! I've got this song idea that's been stuck in my head for days, and I think it would be awesome if you could help me generate a song based on it. Here’s what I’m thinking:

The song should have a screamo vibe, with intense emotions and powerful vocals. It should feel like something that could have come out between 2008-2010. The theme of the song revolves around people playing King of the Hill, where they fight on a hill until one person remains. This gives the song a raw, competitive, and somewhat chaotic energy.

Here are some lyrics that I remember (or at least close to what I remember):

"No regrets, nothing left to lose  
I may not make it back  
This night is mine, this night is mine"

Can you help me create a song with these features? Let's call it "King of the Hill." Looking forward to what you come up with!
