Hey there! I've got this song stuck in my head that feels like it’s from the 80s or early 90s, and it’s super upbeat—like a dance/disco vibe. It reminds me a lot of Stevie Wonder's style. The part I remember sounds like the chorus starting with “you’ve got to break (pause) through.” Since I can’t seem to find it anywhere, could you help me generate a song like that? Something with those lyrics and energy would be amazing!

I've set up a song with an 80s and early 90s vibe, capturing that upbeat dance/disco style reminiscent of Stevie Wonder. Here are the lyrics I've generated for you:

```
[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the rhythm, feel it too
Dancing under starry skies
Let the music take you high

[verse]
Step by step, we move along
In this journey of song and fun
Every beat, every single sound
Brings us closer, love unbound

[bridge]
Turn it up, let's celebrate
Life's a dance floor, don't be late
Feel the pulse, hear the groove
Together we'll make our hearts improve

[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the rhythm, feel it too
Dancing under starry skies
Let the music take you high
```
