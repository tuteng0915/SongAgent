Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding on the carousel
Round and round we go
Lights are flashing in the night
In this little show

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars

[verse]
Laughter echoes through the air
As the music sways
Lost within this timeless dance
Where the moment stays

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars

[bridge]
Time slips away unnoticed
In this carousel of sound
Lost souls find their rhythm
Going round and round

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars
