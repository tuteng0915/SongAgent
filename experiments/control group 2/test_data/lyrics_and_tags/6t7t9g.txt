Lyrics :
[verse]
Boots on the ground and a hat in my hand
Chasin' the sunset across this land
The dust in the air and the sweat on my brow
This is the life I've been dreamin' of somehow

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn
With the stars above and the road below
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know

[verse]
Spurs jinglin', horses neigh
Headed to the next big show
Livin' for the eight-second ride
Where the wild winds blow

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn
With the stars above and the road below
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know

[bridge]
The nights are long but the dreams are wide
Underneath these vast open skies
Every town's a story, every mile's a song
And this cowboy's where he belongs

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn
With the stars above and the road below
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know
