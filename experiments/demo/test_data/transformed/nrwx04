Alright, let's transform this into a generation request!

**Request to the Song Agent:**  
I need you to generate a song for me. The singer should be female, and the genre is a mix of happy punk, alternative rock, and pop rock. The chorus needs to feel bold and emotionally charged, with lyrics along these lines:  

*"I'd give anything just to hear you say to me that I was right and you were wrong, it's not that hard, go on, go on."*  

Make it catchy, with an upbeat yet slightly edgy vibe that fits the genres mentioned. Can you create something awesome based on this?
