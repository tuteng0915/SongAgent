Hey, song generating agent! I need you to craft an alt rock song that gives off tragically hip vibes. The key lyric here is "one in a million," and at some point in the song, it should be repeated with a drawn-out, almost anthemic feel like "one in a milliooooon, one in a millio-o-on." Let’s capture that raw, edgy energy with a touch of introspection—something that feels both modern and timeless. Can you create this for me?
