Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these streets of memories,
Every corner whispers your name to me.
I've been trying to find where I belong,
But every road just leads back to this song.

[chorus]
We were young, we were wild, and free,
Chasing dreams like they're destiny.
Now I'm standing here at the edge of time,
Wondering if you ever felt the same.

[verse]
These moments fade but never really die,
Caught between the truth and a perfect lie.
I hear your voice in every passing car,
A melody that tells me who we are.

[chorus]
We were young, we were wild, and free,
Chasing dreams like they're destiny.
Now I'm standing here at the edge of time,
Wondering if you ever felt the same.

[bridge]
And it's bittersweet,
These echoes keeping me awake.
In the silence, I can hear us break,
But still, I call out your name.

[chorus]
We were young, we were wild, and free,
Chasing dreams like they're destiny.
Now I'm standing here at the edge of time,
Wondering if you ever felt the same.
