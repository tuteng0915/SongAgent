Hello, song generating agent!

I'm looking to create a song that captures a mysterious vibe with a female vocalist who has a raspy and airy voice. The song should feel like it could have been a big hit in the late 90's or early 2000's.

For the chorus, I'd love it to have a catchy, repetitive line that goes something like:
"Cooling/cruising/ dance, cooling da-a-a-ance"

And somewhere in the bridge, can we include a part where the singer emphasizes a repeated phrase, such as:
"I said it, i said it agaaaaaiiin"

Could you generate some lyrics and tags for this kind of song? Thank you!
