Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique challenge for you. I need you to generate a rock song that matches the following description:

The song should be reminiscent of a childhood memory from Colorado between 2007 and early 2010. It was played on an electronic guitar toy with loud vocals by a male singer, accompanied by drums and guitar music, including prominent guitar chugging.

The lyrics, as far as I can remember, go something like this:
- First verse: 
  - (Something, something)
  - "I'm alive, take a look into my eyes"
  - (Something something) "gonna take me for a ride"

- Chorus:
  - "I'm riiiiiding up... I'm riding uuuup!"

- Additional lyrics:
  - "In your final hour"
  - "What a way to gooooo."

The first verse starts quietly and then builds up to a louder section. The overall tone is energetic and professional-sounding, not typical for a children's toy.

Can you create a song based on this description? Let's bring back a piece of my childhood memory!
