Lyrics :
[verse]
I see you there, little girl,
Trapped in a world that's cruel and unfurled.
He doesn't see the beauty I do,
Your smile lights up my world, it's true.

[chorus]
Come away, come with me,
Let's leave this all behind, just be free.
Little girl, don't you see?
The life we could have, just you and me.

[verse]
Every tear that falls from your eye,
Is a reason for us to say goodbye.
To all the pain, to all the lies,
In my arms, darling, is where freedom lies.

[chorus]
Come away, come with me,
Let's leave this all behind, just be free.
Little girl, don't you see?
The life we could have, just you and me.

[bridge]
Maybe love, or maybe care,
All I know, I want you there.
By my side, out in the air,
Running free, without a care.

[chorus]
Come away, come with me,
Let's leave this all behind, just be free.
Little girl, don't you see?
The life we could have, just you and me.
