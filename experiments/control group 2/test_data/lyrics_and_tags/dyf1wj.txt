Lyrics :
[verse 1]
I was born under a strange old moon,
With fur that grew since I was in the womb.
Now my friends do not know,
What it's like to be so alone.

[chorus]
But I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll improvise.

[verse 2]
Through the woods, we'd run free,
Howling songs of sweet melody.
And though they'd laugh at school,
I found love that made me feel cool.

[chorus]
But I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll improvise.

[bridge]
Oh, the years have been kind,
To this heart that they could never define.
Together we'll roam, through fields far and wide,
With you by my side, there's nothing to hide.

[chorus]
'Cause I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll harmonize.

[outro]
So here's to the wolf who dances in me,
The one that set my spirit free.
