Lyrics :
[verse] We're playing with fire, but we don't need no flame
Gonna ride this moment, gonna stake my claim
The night's like a canvas, let's paint it red
With every heartbeat, feel the thrill spread

[chorus] I'm gonna give you my heart, gonna let it ignite
Through the darkness we'll dance, under electric light
No surrender, no retreat, love's a battlefield tonight
I'm gonna give you my heart, gonna make it right

[bridge] In the shadows we move, like whispers in the dark
Every step that we take leaves a blazing mark
Hold on tight, there's no turning back now
Together we'll conquer, together we'll wow

[chorus] I'm gonna give you my heart, gonna let it ignite
Through the darkness we'll dance, under electric light
No surrender, no retreat, love's a battlefield tonight
I'm gonna give you my heart, gonna make it right
