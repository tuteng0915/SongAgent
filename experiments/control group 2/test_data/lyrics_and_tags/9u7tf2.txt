Lyrics :
[verse]
You kissed me goodbye at the break of dawn,
But your smile hid a secret, and now I'm drawn
To whispers in the night, shadows on the wall,
Is my love true—or is it all a ruse, a clandestine call?

[chorus]
CIA or FBI, what’s your undercover lie? 
I thought we had forever, but now I see through your disguise. 
With every punch card you clock, there's a mystery to unlock—
Baby, are you spying on me while we dance cheek to cheek?

[verse]
Your trench coat hides more than just your frame,
And those sunglasses aren’t shielding any rain. 
You dodge my questions with a laugh so sly, 
But I’ve got questions brewing deeper than the ocean or sky.

[chorus]
CIA or FBI, what’s your undercover lie? 
I thought we had forever, but now I see through your disguise. 
With every punch card you clock, there's a mystery to unlock—
Baby, are you spying on me while we dance cheek to cheek?

[bridge]
The clues keep piling up, like files in some dark room,
Each rendezvous smells faintly of espionage perfume. 
Your phone buzzes late at night with encrypted dreams—
Are you protecting our nation, or breaking my heart schemes?

[chorus]
CIA or FBI, what’s your undercover lie? 
I thought we had forever, but now I see through your disguise. 
With every punch card you clock, there's a mystery to unlock—
Baby, are you spying on me while we dance cheek to cheek?

[outro]
So here’s my resignation from this double-life charade,
‘Cause love shouldn’t come with dossiers laid out in parade.
If you’re chasing secrets, then let me make it plain—
I won’t compete with badges; find someone else to surveil.
