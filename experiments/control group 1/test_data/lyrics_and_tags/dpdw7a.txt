Lyrics :
[verse]
In the deep blue silence, where shadows softly sway,
Where the ocean's whispers play a haunting melody.

[chorus]
Beneath the waves we dance, in an embrace so vast,
A world unknown, where time seems to hold its breath.

[verse]
Through kelp forests swaying, in a realm of muted sound,
Colors blur and blend, as we leave the light behind.

[chorus]
Beneath the waves we dance, in an embrace so vast,
A world unknown, where time seems to hold its breath.

[bridge]
Dreamlike currents carry us, through realms of liquid dreams,
In this aqueous haven, where reality redeems.
