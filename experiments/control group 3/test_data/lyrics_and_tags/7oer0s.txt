Lyrics :
[verse]
We've fought our way through every test
Side by side, we gave our best
[chorus]
Together we rise, together we fly (OH-OH)
Victory's song, we'll never die (OH-OH)
With every heartbeat, hear the sound
Of triumph that we've all found
[bridge]
Electric beats and steel-stringed might
Fuel our fire, keep us alight
[chorus]
Together we rise, together we fly (OH-OH)
Victory's song, we'll never die (OH-OH)
With every heartbeat, hear the sound
Of triumph that we've all found
[outro]
Celebrate this night, let spirits soar
A bond unbroken, forever more
