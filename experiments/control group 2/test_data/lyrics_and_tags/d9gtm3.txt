Lyrics :
[verse]
I know you’re a dreamer
Lost in your world of make-believe
Floating on clouds, so high above
Where the air is thin and love's unseen

[chorus]
Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to lose
A guitar riff takes you away
To find the truth in what you choose
With a heart that’s brave, there’s no delay

[bridge]
In the silence, hear your soul
Whispering secrets, making whole
The pieces of a broken muse
Find your path, there’s no excuse

[chorus]
Now you’ve got nothing, nothing left to fear
A melody that’s crystal clear
Guides you forward, break the fuse
With a newfound vision, pave the way, don’t lose
