Lyrics :
[chorus]
The one I'm missing is you
In every moment, in all I do
I feel your absence anew
Wishing you were here, too

[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Memories linger where we used to meet
Every corner holds a trace of you
A silhouette against the sky so blue

[bridge]
Time moves on, but it doesn't heal
The void remains, an open seal
Hoping someday our paths will cross again
Until then, my heart won't settle or bend
