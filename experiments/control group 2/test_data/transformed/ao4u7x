Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

Iâ€™d like you to generate a song based on these features:  
- It should evoke the style of music popular in the 2010s, with significant airplay on alternative radio stations, particularly around the DC area.  
- The percussion should prominently feature the sound of a chain as a rhythmic element.  
- The lead vocalist should be female, and the overall vibe should blend gospel and soul influences.  
- The lyrics should revolve around themes of being underwater or in a river, creating an evocative, immersive atmosphere.  
- Avoid copying "Beast" by Nico Vega, but take inspiration from its raw energy.  
- Include a nod to the artist/band having the word "Family" in their name, perhaps subtly weaving that theme into the lyrics or tone.  

Please generate the lyrics and tags for this song!
