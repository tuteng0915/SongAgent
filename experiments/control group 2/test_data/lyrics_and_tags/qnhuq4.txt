Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding the storm, feel the thunder in my veins,
Metal machine roaring, breaking all chains.

[chorus]
Bang bang, hear the sirens scream,
Da bang, da dang, diggy diggy dream.
Shredding through the night, never gonna stop,
Feel the fire burn, let it rip and pop.

[verse]
Steel wheels rolling, crushing everything in sight,
Raspy whispers turning into a banshee's flight.

[chorus]
Bang bang, hear the sirens scream,
Da bang, da dang, diggy diggy dream.
Shredding through the night, never gonna stop,
Feel the fire burn, let it rip and pop.

[bridge]
Inferno rising, flames licking the sky,
Drums pounding loud, making ears comply.
Guitars wailing, like wolves on the prowl,
This is our kingdom, this is our howl.

[chorus]
Bang bang, hear the sirens scream,
Da bang, da dang, diggy diggy dream.
Shredding through the night, never gonna stop,
Feel the fire burn, let it rip and pop.
