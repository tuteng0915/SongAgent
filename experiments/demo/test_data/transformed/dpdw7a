Hey there! I want to create a song that fits the following description:  

It should be a mid-late 2000s rock song with a mellow vibe. The theme of the lyrics should evoke an underwater, dreamlike, and slightly psychedelic atmosphere—imagine two girls living in a surreal aquatic world within their own apartment. There’s a subtle romantic undertone between them, but it's not explicitly stated. Oh, and the singer should have a male voice.  

Can you generate something like this for me?
