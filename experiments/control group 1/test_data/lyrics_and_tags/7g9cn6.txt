Lyrics :
[spoken-word intro]
You think you can just walk all over me?
I gave you everything, trusted you with my soul,
and this is how you repay me?
[chorus]
Broken promises, shattered dreams,
Your deceitful whispers cut deeper than it seems.
But I rise from the ashes of your lies,
Stronger than ever, watch me fly.

[verse]
The scars you left are fading now,
Pain turns to power, I'll show you how.
Every heartbeat fuels my fire,
In the end, you'll see I'm the one who's higher.
