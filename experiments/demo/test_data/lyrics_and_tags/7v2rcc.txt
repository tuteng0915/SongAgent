Lyrics :
[Intro]
Go and leave me, in the silence of your wake

[Verse]
In the haze of neon lights, chasing shadows in the night
We're the rebels, we're the fights, bound by dreams but not by sight

[Chorus]
Oh, we'll scream out loud, voices echoing through the crowd
Everything will be alright, alright, riding waves of highs and doubts

[Bridge]
Every heartbeat pounds defiance, in this chaotic dance of life
Eyes wide open, fueled by fire, burning through another Friday night
