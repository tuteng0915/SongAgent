Lyrics :
[verse]
In shadows deep, where whispers call,
A fleeting glimpse, she steals it all.
No compass points to where I stand,
Her eyes like stars in shifting sand.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.

[verse]
Footsteps echo down deserted streets,
Our rhythm syncs with every heartbeat.
Moonlight dances on her silhouette,
In this ghostly waltz, there's no regret.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.

[bridge]
Haunted nights, our spirits entwine,
Invisible threads, a bond undefined.
Through misty veils, our futures blend,
An unforeseen path, where shadows bend.

[chorus]
Didn't mean to fall, under her spell,
A twist of fate, a haunted tale to tell.
Hearts collide in midnight's cloak,
Unintended love, a secret vow we spoke.
