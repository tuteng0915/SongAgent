I need more details about the song. What should be the overall theme or message of the lyrics?
Agent : 
Sure, let's dive deeper into the theme and message of your song. Could you tell me what kind of emotions or stories you want to convey through this song? For example, is it about love, hope, a personal journey, or perhaps something more abstract like the beauty of nature? Also, do you have any preferences for the style or genre of the music? This will help me create something that truly resonates with your vision.
User : 
The theme should be about lost love and the pain of separation. It's a personal journey of coming to terms with someone leaving. I don't have a specific genre in mind, just something that feels authentic.

Great, thank you for sharing that. A song about lost love and the pain of separation can be very powerful. To ensure we capture the authenticity you're looking for, I'll go ahead and set some tags based on this theme.

Let's aim for a style that conveys deep emotion and introspection. I'll set the tags accordingly. 

I'll also draft some initial lyrics to give you a sense of direction. We can always refine them later.

Calling the `param_setter` tool now.

  [verse]
  In the silence, echoes of your name
  A ghost of memories, I can't reclaim
  
  [chorus]
  Lost in the shadows of what we had
  Fading like whispers, a love gone bad
  But I'll find peace, though you're miles away
  In the remnants of yesterday
  
  [verse]
  Walking these streets, where we used to roam
  Feeling so lost, trying to find home
  
  [chorus]
  Lost in the shadows of what we had
  Fading like whispers, a love gone bad
  But I'll find peace, though you're miles away
  In the remnants of yesterday
  
  [bridge]
  The pain will linger, but time will heal
  In the quiet moments, I'll feel
  The strength to let go, and start anew
  Though every step feels heavy with you
