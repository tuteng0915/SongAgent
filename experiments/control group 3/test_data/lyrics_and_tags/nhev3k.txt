Lyrics :
[verse]
Feel the beat, it's our time to shine
Together we're stronger, hearts intertwined
Underneath electric skies, we unite
Love's the rhythm that makes us ignite

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity

[verse]
Electric pulses, moving you and me
A symphony of souls in harmony
In this space, where dreams are realized
Our spirits soaring, riding on the tide

[pre-drop]
Female voice: Dance dance dance

[drop]
Background faintly continues: Dance dance dance

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity

[bridge]
Through the night, till the morning light
Every heartbeat joins in the fight
For a world where love conquers all
Together we rise, never gonna fall

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity
