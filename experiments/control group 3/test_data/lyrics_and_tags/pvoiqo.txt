Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of night, under endless skies,
Our hands intertwine, where love never lies.
Every star above, whispers your name,
In this moment, nothing else matters the same.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.

[verse]
Each gentle touch, a promise anew,
Under the cosmos, I'm lost in you.
No challenge too great, no distance too far,
For you are my beacon, my guiding star.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.

[bridge]
In the silence, I hear your sweet voice,
A melody eternal, that makes my heart rejoice.
Through the darkness, your light shines through,
I am nothing without you, my love so true.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.
