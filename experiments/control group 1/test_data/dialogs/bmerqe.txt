User : 
I need a song that starts with an old man in a hospital bed, and then a woman comes in singing "Do you remember" with a marching band. It should have flashbacks and be like Florence and the Machine. Can you do that?

Sure, I can create that song for you. To make sure it fits your expectations, I'll set the tags to include "Florence and the Machine", "marching band", "flashbacks", "hospital", and "nostalgic". Here's a draft of the lyrics:

[Verse]
In a room where time stands still,
An old man lies, his heart to fill.
Memories fade, yet dreams persist,
A life once lived, now misted twist.

[Chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The days we danced through it all.
With every heartbeat, with every breath,
We march ahead, defying death.

[Bridge]
And as she enters, singing clear,
Her voice ignites what was held dear.
Flashbacks flood, a vivid stream,
Of battles fought and love supreme.
