Hello, Song Agent! I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of an 80s or 90s pop vibe, something you might hear in a shopping mall with semi-synth sounds. The song should feature piano/synth and chimes, creating an up-tempo, bossa nova-like rhythm, reminiscent of "The Girl From Ipanema." It should also have a softer male vocal singing along with the melody. The overall feel should be light and breezy, like a shopping spree soundtrack, but a bit slower than "Vibe" by Cookie Kawaii. Can you help me create this?

I've set up the song with the tags and lyrics that capture the essence of an 80s or 90s pop vibe you're looking for. The lyrics reflect a light and breezy feel, perfect for a shopping spree soundtrack with bossa nova-like rhythm and semi-synth sounds.
