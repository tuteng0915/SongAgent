Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking along the sandy shore
The sun setting, our hearts wanting more
Hand in hand, we danced with the waves
Underneath the starlit skies, love stays

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights by the sea
With your laughter echoing free
Every moment, a cherished melody
Our love story, written in harmony

[verse]
Seashells and footprints in the sand
Promises made, forever we stand
The ocean whispers secrets untold
In this paradise, we found love bold

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights by the sea
With your laughter echoing free
Every moment, a cherished melody
Our love story, written in harmony

[bridge]
The tides may change, seasons will turn
Yet in my heart, our fire still burns

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights by the sea
With your laughter echoing free
Every moment, a cherished melody
Our love story, written in harmony
