Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the city, where the lights never fade
There's a spirit unbroken, in the dance of the brave

[chorus]
We rise, like the sun breaking free from the night
With laughter and courage, we shine so bright
Through every storm, we hold on tight
Finding joy in each new day's light

[verse]
Underneath the grey skies, where dreams often collide
Voices echo stronger, with hope as our guide

[chorus]
We rise, like the sun breaking free from the night
With laughter and courage, we shine so bright
Through every storm, we hold on tight
Finding joy in each new day's light

[bridge]
Oh, the British rain falls, but we don't mind
For every drop is a melody, in our hearts entwined
Together we stand, through thick and thin
With resilience woven, in the fabric within

[chorus]
We rise, like the sun breaking free from the night
With laughter and courage, we shine so bright
Through every storm, we hold on tight
Finding joy in each new day's light

[outro]
So let the music play, let the echoes ring true
In this journey of life, there's a place for me and you
