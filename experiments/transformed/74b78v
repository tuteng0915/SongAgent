Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. I want it to be something newerish, not an older classic like "Sweet Caroline." The song should have a soft rock or folky feel to it. I’m thinking of lyrics that might sound something like, "Oh oh feeeoline, I've been lost since the ????" — you get the drift. Can you generate something with that kind of mood and style?
