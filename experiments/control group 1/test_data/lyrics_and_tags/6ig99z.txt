Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been walking down this lonely road
It's a path I've come to know
But tonight the stars are guiding me
To a place where I can breathe

[chorus]
Let the night sing its song
Guide me where I belong
Through the darkness, there's a light
Shining on, shining strong

[verse]
Every step is a memory
Every turn, a mystery
I hear whispers in the silence
Calling out my destiny

[chorus]
Let the night sing its song
Guide me where I belong
Through the darkness, there's a light
Shining on, shining strong

[bridge]
And if the world should crumble
And dreams turn into dust
I'll hold onto this moment
In you, I put my trust

[chorus]
Let the night sing its song
Guide me where I belong
Through the darkness, there's a light
Shining on, shining strong
