Lyrics :
[verse]
Do do do dodo something for Michael
In the heart of the night, we're dancing like never before
The rhythm takes over, we can't ignore

[chorus]
Feel the beat, feel the heat, under neon lights
Together we'll conquer, together we'll fight
For every moment, for every dream in sight
We'll keep on moving till the morning light

[verse]
Do do do dodo give it all for Daniel
Underneath the moonlight, our shadows intertwine
With every step forward, we leave behind

[chorus]
Feel the beat, feel the heat, under neon lights
Together we'll conquer, together we'll fight
For every moment, for every dream in sight
We'll keep on moving till the morning light

[bridge]
The night is young, and so are we
With hearts wide open, we're free to be
As the stars above guide you and me
Towards the horizon where futures gleam

[chorus]
Feel the beat, feel the heat, under neon lights
Together we'll conquer, together we'll fight
For every moment, for every dream in sight
We'll keep on moving till the morning light

[outro]
And as the sun rises, we'll softly sway
With guitars whispering what words can't say
Do do do dodo something for James
In this journey of life, forever we'll blaze
