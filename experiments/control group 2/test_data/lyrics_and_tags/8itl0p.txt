Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been waiting for the moment to arise
Trapped inside these walls, can't see the skies
But now I hear it calling, feel the fire ignite
Time to break out, let the spirit take its flight

[chorus]
Walls are crashing down, hear the sound explode
Dubstep in my veins, rock and roll unloads
Feel the thunder shake, as we rise above
Breaking every chain, this is boundless love

[verse]
Every heartbeat pounds like a drum in my chest
Syncopated rhythms won't let me suppress
The power that's been building up inside
Now's the time to run, no need to hide

[bridge]
The echoes of the past can't hold us anymore
We'll tear through the night, unlock every door
Freedom's in our grasp, nothing left to lose
Let the music guide us, let the groove seduce

[chorus]
Walls are crashing down, hear the sound explode
Dubstep in my veins, rock and roll unloads
Feel the thunder shake, as we rise above
Breaking every chain, this is boundless love
