Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking along the shoreline, footsteps in the sand,
We've journeyed far today, hand in weary hand.

[chorus]
As the sun dips low, painting skies so wide,
Our hearts echo the waves, with secrets they confide.

[verse]
The day's adventures linger, tales we'll always keep,
In the quiet of the evening, where dreams softly seep.

[chorus]
As the sun dips low, painting skies so wide,
Our hearts echo the waves, with secrets they confide.

[bridge]
And if tomorrow takes us to places unknown,
We'll carry this moment, where seeds of hope are sown.
