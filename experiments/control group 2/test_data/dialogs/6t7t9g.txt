Alright, let me transform this into a generation request for the song agent:

---

Hey song agent! I need you to generate an upbeat, energetic country song in the style of Chris LeDoux, George Strait, or Garth Brooks from the 80s or early 90s. The theme should revolve around rodeos and cowboy life, capturing that classic Western vibe. One key lyric I’d like included is “Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton” — it can be part of a chorus or verse, but make sure it stands out. Keep the tempo faster and lively, something people could line dance to. Can you also include tags so I know what kind of mood and genre we're working with?

[verse]  
Boots on the ground and a hat in my hand  
Chasin' the sunset across this land  
The dust in the air and the sweat on my brow  
This is the life I've been dreamin' of somehow  

[chorus]  
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton  
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn  
With the stars above and the road below  
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know  

[verse]  
Spurs jinglin', horses neigh  
Headed to the next big show  
Livin' for the eight-second ride  
Where the wild winds blow  

[chorus]  
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton  
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn  
With the stars above and the road below  
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know  

[bridge]  
The nights are long but the dreams are wide  
Underneath these vast open skies  
Every town's a story, every mile's a song  
And this cowboy's where he belongs  

[chorus]  
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton  
Ridin' through Texas till the break of dawn  
With the stars above and the road below  
A cowboy's heart is all he'll ever know
