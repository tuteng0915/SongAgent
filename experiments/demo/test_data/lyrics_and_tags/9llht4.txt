Lyrics :
[verse]
In a small town where whispers grow
A child hides secrets, no one should know
Bruises bloom like a midnight sky
Cries silent tears, wonders why

[chorus]
Oh, little heart so brave and torn
Carrying burdens from the night to morn'
Through the halls where echoes play
No one sees your pain today

[verse]
Another soul walks beside you there
Sees the hurt that you try to bear
Shares his lunch, though he's barely fed
A quiet act of kindness said

[chorus]
Oh, little hearts so brave and torn
Carrying burdens from the night to morn'
Through the halls where echoes play
No one hears your cries today

[bridge]
Someday soon, the truth will break
The chains that bind, the fear will shake
Till then hold tight, don't let go
Hope remains though it's moving slow

[chorus]
Oh, little hearts so brave and torn
Carrying burdens from the night to morn'
Through the halls where echoes play
One day love will find its way
