Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

I’d like you to generate a song based on these features: It should be an upbeat, triumphant-sounding country song with elements of rock or pop hybridization, reminiscent of something released between 2012-2014. The rhythm is fast and energetic, the kind that would fit into a mall’s “cool music” playlist even though it leans toward country. The song opens with a standout acoustic guitar solo, and the riffs from that solo carry throughout the track. Include lyrics where one line stands out as "Well that's fine by me," but make sure it doesn’t sound like Andy Grammer’s style—keep it more in the country vibe. Let’s see what you can create!
