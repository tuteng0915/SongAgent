Lyrics :
[Instrumental Intro]

[Dialogue - Man]
"Do you ever think about how music can change the way we feel?"

[Dialogue - Woman]
"All the time. Itâ€™s like each note carries a piece of our soul."

[Dialogue - Man]
"Meaning in life is just something you cultivate."

[Dialogue - Woman]
"Like roses?"

[Dialogue - Man]
"Exactly like roses. Until it's not."

[Verse]
In the quiet moments, we find our peace
A gentle whisper, where worries cease

[Bridge]
Let the echoes of the keys, carry you away
To a place of serenity, where dreams hold sway

[Outro]
[End Chord Progression]
