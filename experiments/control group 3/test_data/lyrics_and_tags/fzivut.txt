Lyrics :
[verse]
I remember the laughter in your eyes,
A love that once shone, now a sweet surprise.

[chorus]
Time moves on, but memories stay,
In every heartbeat, in every stray.
Our moments linger, like shadows cast,
A bittersweet symphony, from the past.

[verse]
Walking these streets where we used to roam,
Each corner whispers, of a love once known.

[bridge]
Though you're gone, your spirit remains,
In the quiet echoes, of gentle rains.

[chorus]
Time moves on, but memories stay,
In every heartbeat, in every stray.
Our moments linger, like shadows cast,
A bittersweet symphony, from the past.
