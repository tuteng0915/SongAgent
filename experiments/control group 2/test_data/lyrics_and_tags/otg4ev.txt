Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of our laughter,
I hear your voice again.
Amongst the blooms of springtime,
Your whispers softly spin.

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But when I reach to hold your hand,
The world dissolves like grains of sand.

[verse]
Our songs play on the radio,
Each note a gentle guide.
Yet in the silence that follows,
I find I'm by your side.

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But when I speak, the words collide,
And leave me lost within my mind.

[bridge]
Is it real or just illusion?
A spectral dance or sweet delusion?
With every tear, I ask anew,
Are these moments spent with you?

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But as reality fades away,
I wonder if you'll stay.
