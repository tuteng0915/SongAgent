Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, the city's a battlefield, echoes of gunshots,
Innocent lives lost, dreams turned into comas.
Every corner I turn, another soul departs,
The string section weeps, as I spit from the heart.

[chorus]
Dah (rest) dah dah dah dah (rest) dah dah dah dah,
Rhythms of the street, in this concrete saga.
Violins and cellos, painting pictures with sound,
As I rap about the truth, in this underground.

[verse]
Brothers and sisters falling, caught up in the crossfire,
Tales of woe and strife, that's what I'm here to describe.
Peace is the mission, but violence is the norm,
I use my words as weapons, to fight against the storm.

[bridge]
We need to rise up, like the sun in the morning,
Break the chains of hate, stop the endless mourning.
Education is power, knowledge is the key,
To unlock the doors, set our minds and spirits free.

[chorus]
Dah (rest) dah dah dah dah (rest) dah dah dah dah,
Rhythms of the street, in this concrete saga.
Violins and cellos, painting pictures with sound,
As I rap about the truth, in this underground.
