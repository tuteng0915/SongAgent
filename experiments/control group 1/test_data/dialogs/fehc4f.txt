Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the theme or message you want the song to convey. What's the song about?
Agent : 
Great! To better understand your needs, could you please tell me more about the theme or message you want the song to convey? Additionally, I can get some preferences from you to tailor the song more closely to your liking. Let's proceed with that.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since you haven't provided specific preferences yet, I'll go ahead and generate a song based on a general theme. Let's say the song is about "hope and new beginnings."

I will now set the tags and lyrics for the song.

[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I see a path that shines so bright.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.

[verse]
Every step feels lighter than before,
Doors open wide, thereâ€™s so much more.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.

[bridge]
Through the storms, through the rain,
We will find our way again.

[chorus]
Rise again, rise above,
With the strength of an endless love.
Hope is calling, hear its song,
Together we can't go wrong.
