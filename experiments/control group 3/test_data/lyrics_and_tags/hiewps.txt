Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I remember her smile,
A dance in the rain, our first meeting, so wild.
She fought with all she had, but fate took its toll,
Now it's just you and me, son, filling the void in our soul.

[chorus]
Oh, love, it burns like a flame,
In the ashes, our memories remain.
Through loss, we learn to grow,
Her legacy, in our hearts, we'll sow.

[verse]
She taught us to stand tall, even when we fall down,
To cherish every moment, for life's a fragile crown.
Though she's gone, her spirit lives on, in you and me,
Together we'll face the world, forever we'll be free.

[bridge]
And though the pain never fully fades away,
We find strength in each other, come what may.
With every tear, there's a lesson learned,
In this journey of love, where hearts are eternally yearned.

[chorus]
Oh, love, it burns like a flame,
In the ashes, our memories remain.
Through loss, we learn to grow,
Her legacy, in our hearts, we'll sow.
