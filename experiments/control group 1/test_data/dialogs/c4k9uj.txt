Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre and mood of the song. You mentioned dance/disco beats and a nostalgic vibe from the early or mid-2000s. Would you say the genre is primarily disco-pop, and the mood is upbeat yet reflective?

That sounds about right! To make sure I capture your preferences accurately, let's define the genre as disco-pop and the mood as upbeat yet reflective. If you have any specific artists or songs from that era you'd like me to draw inspiration from, please share them now.

Once we've nailed down these details, I'll generate some tags and lyrics for your song. How does that sound?
