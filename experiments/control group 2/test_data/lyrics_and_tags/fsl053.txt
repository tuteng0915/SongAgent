Lyrics :
[verse]
Shackles and chains
Binding me tight
Memories of yesterday
Haunt me every night

[chorus]
The echoes call out my name
In the silence, I hear it plain
The rhythm of the past
In my heart, it will always last

[verse]
Walking down this lonely road
With a heavy heart, I carry on
The tunes of old, they guide me home
Where I belong, where I'm never alone

[chorus]
The echoes call out my name
In the silence, I hear it plain
The rhythm of the past
In my heart, it will always last

[bridge]
Though time has passed
And nothing's ever gonna be the same
I'll keep these moments
Forever engraved in my soul

[chorus]
The echoes call out my name
In the silence, I hear it plain
The rhythm of the past
In my heart, it will always last
