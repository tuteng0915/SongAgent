Lyrics :
[verse]
I remember the days, we were young and free
Skating through the night, just you and me

[chorus]
We'll be together again, in this endless summer
Feeling the rush, like a love-struck drummer

[verse]
Neon lights and loud guitars
Living fast, we pushed the cars

[chorus]
We'll be together again, in this endless summer
Feeling the rush, like a love-struck drummer

[bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, let's go all the way tonight
We won't regret it, our runaway flight

[chorus]
Together again, in this endless summer
Just like before, feeling no surrender
