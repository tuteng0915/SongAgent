Hello, Song Agent! I’d like you to *generate* a song based on the following features:

The song should feel like it could have been released around the turn of the decade and could have gained popularity on platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. It should feature a single male artist (or possibly a duo), with an artist name consisting of two words, the first being something like “El” or another similar particle.

The melody should prominently include a steel drum loop, and the beat should draw inspiration from reggae or moombahton. The lyrics can be playful yet rhythmic, capturing the vibe of someone performing live and experimenting with sounds.

For the music video concept, imagine shots of the artist energetically banging his drumsticks on a drum pad to the backbeat, alternating with him fiddling around on a keyboard or sample pad. Intersperse these scenes with visuals of girls taking their shirts off, popping balloons, and maybe even shooting a bow and arrow for some quirky, carefree energy.

Let’s create something that feels nostalgic yet fresh—ready to bring this idea to life?
