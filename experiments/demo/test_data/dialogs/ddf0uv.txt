I want a song with a 60s vibe, simple and raw, not too produced. Can we start with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's set the tags for your song to capture the 60s vibe you're looking for, while keeping it simple and raw.

I will now set the tags for your song.


Successfully set the parameter tags
The tags have been set to achieve that 60s vibe with a focus on simplicity and rawness. Now, let's work on some lyrics. Since you're aiming for a 60s style, do you have any specific themes or topics in mind for the song? For example, love, peace, youthful rebellion, or perhaps a significant historical event from that era? This will help me tailor the lyrics appropriately.
User : 
Let's go with something about youthful rebellion, maybe a story about breaking free or going against the norm. Something that fits with the times.
Agent : 
Great choice! A theme of youthful rebellion will fit perfectly with the 60s vibe. I'll draft some lyrics that capture the spirit of breaking free and going against the norm.

I will now generate the initial lyrics for your song based on the theme of youthful rebellion.

The lyrics have been created, capturing a narrative of youthful rebellion and the desire to break free from societal constraints, typical sentiments of the 60s era. Here's what I've drafted:

[verse]
In the shadowed streets we roam,
Whispers of change in every home,
The times they are a-changin' fast,
We're breaking free from the chains of the past.

[chorus]
Oh, we'll sing out loud, our voices clear,
Against the tide, we have no fear,
With hearts unbound, we pave the way,
For a brighter dawn, a brand new day.

[verse]
Signs of protest line the square,
Echoes of hope fill the air,
Unyielding spirits, young and bold,
A story of rebellion, forever told.

[bridge]
Hand in hand, we stand tall tonight,
Our dreams will guide us towards the light,
No longer silent, we make our stand,
In the pages of history, we leave our mark.

The lyrics are good, but can we add a marching snare drum to the mix? It should give it that rugged cowboy feel. And maybe specify the vocal style too?

I've updated the tags to include a marching snare drum for that rugged cowboy feel, along with specifying a rebellious vocal style. This should complement the youthful rebellion theme in the lyrics and enhance the overall 60s vibe.
