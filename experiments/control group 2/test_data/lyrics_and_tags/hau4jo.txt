Lyrics :
[verse]
In the glow of her phone screen light,
Juliet texts through another night.
Her dad's watchin' every move she makes,
While Romeo waits outside, hearts at stake.

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet,
And Juliet's feelin' Romeo.
Through the walls that separate their worlds,
Their love grows in secret shows.

[verse]
He was a star on the field before,
Now he plays a different score.
An injury stole his game away,
But not his heart, come what may.

[bridge]
Jewish stars and city nights,
Two worlds collide under neon lights.
Dancing through the pain and the joy they find,
A rhythm only they can align.

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet,
And Juliet's feelin' Romeo.
Through the whispers and the silent calls,
Their love echoes through it all.

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet,
And Juliet's feelin' Romeo.
With every step, with every fall,
Together they'll conquer it all.
