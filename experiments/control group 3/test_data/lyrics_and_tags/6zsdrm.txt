Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the quiet of the night, I hear your voice
Whispering softly, making me rejoice

[Chorus]
Longing for you, under the moon so blue
Every moment, every breath, my heart beats for you
Don't let me goooooooo

[Bridge]
The stars above, they guide me to where you are
In this journey, youâ€™re my guiding star
