Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I want to generate a song based on a very specific and eerie concept. The song should revolve around a chilling narrative involving a woman who encounters a mysterious little girl in a wheelchair at a gas station mart. The girl drops a toy, and when the woman tries to return it, she finds herself in a nightmare scenario where she’s forced into a false family role—pretending to be the wife and mother of the people who trapped her. Eventually, she ends up digging her own grave before being buried alive while still singing.

The tone should be haunting, melancholic, and somewhat surreal, with lyrics that capture both her initial confusion and eventual despair. The style can have a dark cinematic feel, reminiscent of gothic or alternative music from before 2015. 

Please include these key elements:
- A description of the gas station encounter.
- The moment when she realizes she's trapped in this false life.
- Her emotions as she digs her own grave and sings through the horror.

Can you create something that fits this mood and storyline?

  [verse]
  At the gas station mart, a girl in a wheelchair
  A fallen toy at her feet, so unaware
  I picked it up with a smile, asked if she was alright
  Her eyes, they gleamed, under the cold moonlight

  [chorus]
  Trapped in their web, I'm losing myself
  In this false life on a cursed shelf
  Pretend to be wife, pretend to be mom
  But my soul is screaming, where do I belong?

  [verse]
  They took me home, their faces so kind
  But behind closed doors, chains that bind
  The walls whisper secrets, shadows play their part
  I'm sinking deeper into this broken heart

  [bridge]
  Digging my grave, hands bleeding and raw
  Forced to sing as I face my last straw
  The melody haunts, like ghosts in the air
  Each note a tear, each breath a prayer

  [chorus]
  Buried alive, yet my voice won't die
  Singing for help beneath the cold sky
  A nightmare made real, no escape from this place
  Eternal silence wraps its embrace

  [outro]
  Still singing softly, though there's no one near
  My song ascends, carried by fear
  Through dirt and darkness, it will always remain
  A haunting echo of my endless pain
