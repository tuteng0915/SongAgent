Hello, song agent! I'd like you to generate a song based on a concept I recently came across. The song should be cheerful on the surface but have a deeper, more somber meaning. It should be about a woman who has lost her husband and is talking to him. The lyrics should leave it ambiguous whether she's truly communicating with him or if she's descending into madness. Can you create something that captures this bittersweet sentiment?

I've crafted a song that I believe captures the bittersweet sentiment you described. It conveys both the cheerful exterior and the somber, deeper meaning of loss and ambiguity about one's sanity. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
In the echoes of our laughter,
I hear your voice again.
Amongst the blooms of springtime,
Your whispers softly spin.

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But when I reach to hold your hand,
The world dissolves like grains of sand.

[verse]
Our songs play on the radio,
Each note a gentle guide.
Yet in the silence that follows,
I find I'm by your side.

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But when I speak, the words collide,
And leave me lost within my mind.

[bridge]
Is it real or just illusion?
A spectral dance or sweet delusion?
With every tear, I ask anew,
Are these moments spent with you?

[chorus]
Oh darling, you're here with me,
In every shadow, every tree.
But as reality fades away,
I wonder if you'll stay.
