Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the main theme or emotion you want the song to convey. Should it be more on the upbeat and lively side, or do you prefer a softer, more introspective tone?
Agent : 
Great! To better tailor the song to your preferences, let's also consider a few more aspects:
- Do you have any specific genre in mind, such as pop, rock, electronic, etc.?
- Are there particular instruments or sounds you'd like to feature?
- Any specific topics or stories you want the lyrics to cover?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to generate a song that closely matches your vision. Please share your thoughts on these points.

I'm thinking of something soft and introspective, with a 70s-80s acoustic guitar vibe. Does that make sense?
Agent : 

the user has not given their preferences yet.
That makes perfect sense. A soft and introspective song with a 70s-80s acoustic guitar vibe sounds wonderful. Let me summarize the details we have so far:

- Emotion: Soft and introspective
- Era/Vibe: 70s-80s
- Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar

To ensure I capture your preferences accurately, I'll go ahead and set these tags for the song. Once the tags are set, I will proceed to draft some lyrics that fit this theme.

[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I strum my dreams on an old guitar.
Each note a whisper, each chord a sigh,
Of days gone by, where memories linger near.

[chorus]
Oh, these strings hold stories untold,
Of love and loss, of hearts grown cold.
But in this silence, they find their way,
To speak of hope, come what may.

[verse]
Beneath the shade of the willow tree,
Where time stands still, and so do I.
With every pluck, a memory flows,
Through rivers deep, where shadows lie.

[chorus]
Oh, these strings hold stories untold,
Of love and loss, of hearts grown cold.
But in this silence, they find their way,
To speak of hope, come what may.

[bridge]
And though the world may spin so fast,
These moments last, they always last.
In every echo, in every sound,
There's peace to be found, when you're not bound.

The lyrics are nice, but can we add a part where the artist sings "she crazy," followed by a long, distinct falsetto that goes up and down? It's a key moment I'm looking for.
