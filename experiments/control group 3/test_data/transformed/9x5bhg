Hello, Song Agent! I’d like you to generate a song based on some specific requirements. The song should be inspired by driving on Mulholland, with lyrics that reference its curves and the feeling of moving in and out along the road. The vocal delivery should be somewhere between singing and speaking—kind of a half-sung, half-spoken style. The beat and backing music should have a techno vibe, giving it an electronic and rhythmic feel. Can you create something like that for me?
