Lyrics :
[verse]
I guess I wasn't ready, to see you go
Thought we had more time, but you slipped slow
Shoulda said the things that mattered most
Instead of letting silence burn like ghosts

[chorus]
Now every night I'm haunted by your face
Regretting all the wrong turns I couldn't replace
If only love could turn back time
Then maybe you'd still be here, and I'd be fine

[verse]
You left me with these echoes in my mind
A hollow heart where pieces used to align
Every memory cuts deeper than before
And now there's nothing left except what we ignored

[bridge]
The nights are colder, dreams feel so confined
It's like no matter how hard I try, you're one step behind
But this time, I won't let you fade away
I'll scream it loud, even if it doesn't change a thing

[final line]
I can't believe you died... dad.
