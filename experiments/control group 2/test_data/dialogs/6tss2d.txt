Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some specific details I remember. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should be in the pop punk genre, reminiscent of bands like Less Than Jake or Goldfinger. The song starts with someone mimicking a phone ringing sound using their voice, and during that ringing noise, there’s dialogue where someone says, “I know she’s home.” After the call is picked up, it turns into a phone conversation where the girl delivers some bad news to the guy—maybe she’s breaking up with him, telling him she cheated, or something along those lines.  

Can you generate lyrics for a song like this? It would also be cool if you could add tags so I can see how it fits within the pop punk style.

### Lyrics:

**[intro]**  
*imitating phone ringing*  
"I know she's home."  

**[verse 1]**  
Hello? Is this real?  
I heard your voice, it hit like a steal  
You said you're done, our time's expired  
But I was blind, thought love was fire  

**[chorus]**  
The line went dead, but the words still sting  
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing  
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud  
Of promises broken, they never last long  

**[verse 2]**  
Pick up the pieces, try to move on  
But every ringtone takes me back home  
To that moment when honesty cut  
Like a knife through the fabric of us  

**[chorus]**  
The line went dead, but the words still sting  
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing  
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud  
Of promises broken, they never last long  

**[bridge]**  
And if I could rewind, erase that sound  
Would I change your mind or just fall down?  
Phone calls end, but scars remain deep  
In the story of us, there's no receipt  

**[chorus]**  
The line went dead, but the words still sting  
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing  
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud  
Of promises broken, they never last long  

**[outro]**  
Click... silence.
