Lyrics :
[verse]
In the corners of the room, shadows dance,
A rhythm born, as hands advance.
Unique beats fill the silent air,
A soulful voice, in the night so rare.

[chorus]
Oh, we're chasing stars in the velvet sky,
With every beat, our spirits fly.
In this moment, nothing else matters,
Just the music, and the dreams it scatters.

[verse]
Beneath the moon, where secrets hide,
We find ourselves, no need to confide.
Each note a story, each beat a flame,
Together we rise, never the same.

[chorus]
Oh, we're chasing stars in the velvet sky,
With every beat, our spirits fly.
In this moment, nothing else matters,
Just the music, and the dreams it scatters.

[bridge]
And if the world should fade to grey,
Our song will light the way.
Through every storm, through every fight,
We'll hold on to tonight.
