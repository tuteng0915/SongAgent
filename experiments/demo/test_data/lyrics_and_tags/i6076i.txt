Lyrics :
[verse]
Stuck in this endless loop,
Where silence speaks louder than words,
I watch you smile, it's killing me softly,
Unaware of the storm within.

[chorus]
But I'm just a shadow to you,
A whisper lost in the crowd,
Though my heart beats for you alone,
You'll never see, you'll never know.

[verse]
Walking beside you feels like miles,
Every laugh is a dagger to my soul,
Our moments together, they haunt my dreams,
In your eyes, I'm just a friend.

[chorus]
But I'm just a shadow to you,
A whisper lost in the crowd,
Though my heart beats for you alone,
You'll never see, you'll never know.

[bridge]
Maybe someday you'll turn around,
And notice me standing here,
With a love that's true and unwavering,
Hoping against all odds.

[chorus]
Until then, I remain a shadow,
Fading into the night,
Dreaming of when you'll finally see,
The light that shines only for you.
