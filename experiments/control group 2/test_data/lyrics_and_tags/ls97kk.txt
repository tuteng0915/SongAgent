Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the quiet halls of despair,
A whisper floats in the stale air.
"They are here," you softly say,
As shadows twitch and lights decay.

[Chorus]
Dancing spirits, lost souls spin,
Echoes of madness within.
Radio waves, voices crawl,
Through static, they call... they call.

[Verse]
Bodies move to a ghostly song,
The rhythm's right, but something's wrong.
Silhouettes on the wardened floor,
An invitation to something more.

[Bridge]
Static whispers, secrets unfold,
Truth or madness? The story untold.
Hand in hand with the unseen force,
We surrender to this spectral course.

[Chorus]
Dancing spirits, lost souls spin,
Echoes of madness within.
Radio waves, voices crawl,
Through static, they call... they call.

[Outro]
And as the night begins to wane,
The signal fades, but not the pain.
For every beat, a haunting trace,
The echoes linger, a timeless embrace.
