Lyrics :
[verse]
When the sky turns green and the oceans glow
It's the end of the world, don't you know?
Grab my hand and we'll dance in the street
To the funky beat, it's our last retreat

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[verse]
We'll paint the town with neon dreams
While the world ends in fiery beams
From the ashes rises a disco ball
In this crazy chaos, we'll have a ball

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[bridge]
Oh, the comet's a-calling, but we won't despair
With afros and platforms, we've got flair to spare
Glitter in our hair, stars in our eyes
In this wild ride, we're gonna improvise

[chorus]
Dancing through the doom, laughing at the gloom
With a pocket full of sunshine, we're gonna boom
In this apocalypse, we find our groove
Underneath the moonlight, there's nothing to prove

[verse]
Zombies in the backyard going absolutely nuts
Doing the twist and shouting out "What's up?"
Funny robot voice joins in at the end
Saying "Oh, you had triplets instead of twins? Your pork tastes like chicken?"

[outro]
So we dance on, as the world unwinds
With good vibes only, and open minds
Together we'll face whatever may come
In this apocalypse party, we're second to none
