Lyrics :
[verse]
We're chasing the sun, where it leads
Through the unknown, planting seeds
Every heartbeat, a drum that frees
On this journey, there's no decrees

[chorus]
Riding the rhythm, feeling so free
In this wild world of mystery
Dancing through the night, under neon skies
With every step, adventure never dies

[verse]
Electric dreams in the moonlit glow
Where shadows dance and spirits grow
A symphony of stars above
Guiding us on with their love

[chorus]
Riding the rhythm, feeling so free
In this wild world of mystery
Dancing through the night, under neon skies
With every step, adventure never dies

[bridge]
Letâ€™s get lost in the music tonight
Find our way in the fading light
Together we'll soar, like birds in flight
In this unusual pop delight
