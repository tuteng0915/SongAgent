the value of the parameter tags is:

To better tailor the song to your preferences, I'll first gather some information about your musical tastes.



the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences yet, let's start by you giving me a general idea of what you're looking for.

Let me know so I can generate something that fits your vision!
