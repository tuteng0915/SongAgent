Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these streets I've known
Shadows cast by the setting sun
Every step brings back memories
Of all the things we've done

[chorus]
And the seasons chaaahange!
With every heartbeat calling out my name
In this small town where love was found
And then lost again

[bridge]
Underneath the starry skies
Dreaming of what could have been
We danced together through the night
As the world stood still for us

[chorus]
And the seasons chaaahange!
With every heartbeat calling out my name
In this small town where love was found
And then lost again

[outro]
So here's to the memories
The laughter, the tears, the pain
And to the seasons, they continue to change
