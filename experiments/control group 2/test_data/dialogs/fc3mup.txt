Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate an alternative genre song that captures the essence of a noir-style music video with vivid scenes and stage props. The song should tell the story of a man navigating through a city, encountering various predicaments. Key scenes from the video include the man falling into a spider web but managing to escape, ending up in a hospital where the nurse turns out to be malevolent, prompting him to create makeshift wings from cardboard and 'fly' out of the window.

The song was likely released in the early 2000s and aired on MTV around the same time as Greenday's "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." The lyrics may include a line similar to "Everything goes on and on and on and I..."

Please generate the lyrics and any relevant tags for this song.

I have generated the lyrics and tags for your alternative noir-style song, capturing the vivid scenes and themes you've described. Here are the sections of the lyrics:

[verse]
In the shadows of the alleyways he roams,
A cityscape where danger calls it home,
Caught within a web not of his own making,
Fighting for freedom, no time for breaking.

[chorus]
Everything goes on and on and on,
In this urban labyrinth where he's gone,
With every step, a new scene unfolds,
A noir odyssey, in hues of gold.

[verse]
Hospital walls with their sterile embrace,
A nurse with a smile that conceals her face,
Malevolence cloaked in white attire,
Our hero dreams of flight and fire.

[bridge]
Cardboard wings beat against the night,
A silhouette takes its daring flight,
From the windowsill to the open skies,
A phoenix rising as the world defies.

[chorus]
Everything goes on and on and on,
The city whispers till the break of dawn,
Through the chaos, he finds his way,
In the heart of darkness, he will not stay.

And the tags for the song are: alternative, noir, early 2000s, MTV, Greenday, vivid scenes, predicaments, escape, malevolent, makeshift wings, fly, city navigation.
