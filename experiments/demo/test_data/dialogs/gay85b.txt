I need you to create a song in the alternative/alternative rock genre. The theme is about a city that's going to be destroyed in a year, and everyone knows it. Can you start with that?

Sure, I can start creating a song based on the details you've provided. To make sure I capture your preferences accurately, could you please specify if you prefer a more melancholic or energetic tone for this alternative/alternative rock song? Also, do you have any specific requests regarding the structure of the lyrics, such as including particular sections like verses, choruses, or a bridge?
User : 
Let's go with a melancholic tone. And maybe include some verses and a chorus? The part about the kids not going to school should be in there somewhere.

I've crafted a melancholic alternative/alternative rock song that captures the essence of a city's final year. Here are the lyrics:

```
[verse]
In the shadow of the skyline, whispers float
A city with a death sentence, its final note

[chorus]
The clock is ticking, we all know the score
One year to live, what we're fighting for

[verse]
Kids no longer rush to school, lessons done
Playground songs are silent, under the sun

[chorus]
The clock is ticking, we all know the score
One year to live, dreams we can't restore

[bridge]
Empty streets where laughter used to be
Now just echoes of what's left of you and me
```
