Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre and mood of the song. You mentioned dance/disco beats and a nostalgic vibe from the early or mid-2000s. Would you say the genre is primarily dance-pop, and the mood is upbeat yet nostalgic?
Agent : 
Yes, that sounds accurate. To clarify, the genre is dance-pop with a nostalgic vibe reminiscent of the early to mid-2000s. The mood should be upbeat and energetic while still capturing that sense of nostalgia. 

Let's proceed with these details in mind. I'll set the tags accordingly and begin drafting the lyrics for the song. 

I'll call the `param_setter` tool to set the tags and start working on the lyrics.

Great! The tags have been set to reflect the genre and mood we discussed: "dance-pop, nostalgic, upbeat, energetic, 2000s, electronic, catchy".

Now, let's draft the lyrics. I'll create a basic structure with verses, a chorus, and a bridge. Hereâ€™s a rough outline:

```
[Verse 1]
We were young and free under neon lights,
Dancing all night, everything felt right.
Remember those days, they slipped away,
But tonight, we'll bring them back to play.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
We'll make these memories last forever bright.

[Verse 2]
Glitter on the floor, stars in our eyes,
Every moment felt like paradise.
Lost in the rhythm, lost in the sound,
In this world of ours, nothing can bring us down.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
We'll make these memories last forever bright.

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh, feel the rush,
Like a dream that we never had enough.
Hands in the air, we don't care,
This is our night, we'll take it anywhere.

[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
We'll make these memories last forever bright.
```

I will now use the `param_setter` tool to set these lyrics for the song.

Before we proceed to generate the song, do you think we should add any specific "yeah yeah" parts in the chorus as you initially mentioned? If so, where would you like them placed?
Agent : 
That's a great point. Adding "yeah yeah" parts can enhance the catchiness and energy of the chorus, making it more engaging and reminiscent of dance-pop hits from the 2000s.

Let's modify the chorus to include "yeah yeah" parts. Here's the updated version:

```
[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's go back in time,
Feel the beat, let the music shine.
Dance like nobody's watching tonight,
Yeah yeah, make these memories last forever bright.
```

I'll update the lyrics using the `param_setter` tool with this new version of the chorus.
