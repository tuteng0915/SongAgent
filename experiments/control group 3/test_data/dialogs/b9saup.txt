Hey, I'd like a song that's catchy but has some funny, over-the-top elements. Can we start with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's set some tags to guide the style of the song. Since you want it catchy and funny with over-the-top elements, how about we also add some energetic and whimsical vibes? 

Let me know if this sounds good or if you have any other preferences!


the user has not given their preferences yet.
To better tailor the song to your tastes, could you share what kind of music you usually enjoy? For instance, do you prefer pop, rock, electronic, or any other genre? This will help in creating a song that's more aligned with your preferences. 

In the meantime, I'll set some initial tags based on our conversation so far. Let's go with "catchy," "funny," "over-the-top," "energetic," and "whimsical." If these don't fit exactly what you're looking for, feel free to adjust them!

Great! We've set the initial tags for your song to catchy, funny, over-the-top, energetic, and whimsical. Now let's move on to generating some lyrics. 

For the lyrics, I'll create a simple structure with a verse, chorus, and bridge. Once you see the draft, you can provide feedback or suggest changes. 

Let's get started!

Alright, here's a draft of your song with the following lyrics:

```
[verse] 
Something weird and wonderful, bouncing in my brain,
tickling my thoughts, driving me insane!

[chorus] 
It's the craziest thing, got me laughing and singing,
all through the day.
Oh what a sight, feeling so bright,
life's such a delightful crazy parade!

[bridge] 
Who knew ridiculous could feel so right,
jumping into chaos with delight!
```

Take a look at these lyrics and let me know if there’s anything you’d like to change or add. Once you're happy with them, press the "generate" button to create your song!

That's a good start, but can we make it more modern country rock with an overly produced sound? And add a heavy guitar riff too?

I've updated the tags to include "modern country rock," "heavy guitar riff," and "overly produced" while keeping the elements you liked before. 

With these new tags, your song will have a more modern country rock feel with all the energetic and whimsical elements we discussed earlier.

The song is shaping up, but can we incorporate themes about pickup trucks, beer, and fire? It would be great if these elements were part of the lyrics.

I've updated the lyrics to include themes of pickup trucks, beer, and fire. Here's the revised version:

```
[verse] 
Something weird and wonderful, bouncing in my brain,
tickling my thoughts, driving me insane!
In my pickup truck, under the neon fire,
life's a wild ride spinning like a tire!

[chorus] 
It's the craziest thing, got me laughing and singing,
all through the day.
Oh what a sight, feeling so bright,
raising a beer to the night and the light!

[bridge] 
Who knew ridiculous could feel so right,
jumping into chaos with delight!
With flames on the side and stars in our eyes,
we're revving up dreams in this wild countryside!
```

Take a look at these changes and let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to tweak. Once you’re happy with everything, press the "generate" button to create your song!
