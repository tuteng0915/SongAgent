Hey song agent! I need you to generate a song for me. Here's what I'm looking for:  

It should be an indie folk-style song where the singer repeatedly mentions a woman's name—something that sounds like a "white girl name." The vibe should capture that bittersweet feeling of unrequited love, with lyrics expressing determination despite rejection. Something along the lines of "Even if she rejects me, at least I can say that I tried."  

Can you whip up something based on this? Let’s hear those lyrics and tags!
