Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by confirming a few details. Is the song primarily about a relationship or personal feelings?
Agent : 
Great! Let's dive a bit deeper. Is the song about a romantic relationship, friendship, or perhaps self-reflection and personal growth? Also, do you have any specific themes or emotions in mind that you'd like to express through the lyrics? For example, is it about falling in love, overcoming challenges, or celebrating life? 

Once I have a clearer picture, I can generate something that truly resonates with your vision.
User :

Understood! A romantic song filled with love and longing, centered on the theme of being together despite challenges. To ensure I capture your vision perfectly, let's finalize a few more details:

1. Do you prefer the overall tone to be more upbeat and hopeful, or slow and emotional?
2. Are there any specific scenarios or imagery you'd like included in the lyrics? For example, meeting under the stars, holding hands, etc.
3. Any particular structure you'd like the song to follow? Like the number of verses, choruses, or if you'd like a bridge section.

Once we have these details, I'll generate the lyrics and tags for you. Looking forward to your response!
User : 
Let's go with a slow and emotional tone. As for scenarios, maybe something about holding hands under the stars. The structure doesn't matter much to me.

[verse]
In the quiet of night, under endless skies,
Our hands intertwine, where love never lies.
Every star above, whispers your name,
In this moment, nothing else matters the same.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.

[verse]
Each gentle touch, a promise anew,
Under the cosmos, I'm lost in you.
No challenge too great, no distance too far,
For you are my beacon, my guiding star.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.

[bridge]
In the silence, I hear your sweet voice,
A melody eternal, that makes my heart rejoice.
Through the darkness, your light shines through,
I am nothing without you, my love so true.

[chorus]
Together we stand, through every storm,
With love as our guide, we'll forever transform.
Though miles may stretch, and oceans divide,
My heart beats for you, my love won't subside.
