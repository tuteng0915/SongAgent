Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits the following description:  

- It should have a very early 2000s vibe.  
- The tone is really depressing, emotive, and somber.  
- The singer is female, with a voice that complements the melancholic mood.  
- I initially thought the song was called "Float," but let's take creative liberties with the title while keeping it thematically relevant.  

Can you craft something along these lines?

[verse]
Drifting through the shadows of my mind
Lost in memories, I cannot find
A place to rest, a place to call my own
I'm floating alone, in this endless unknown

[chorus]
Floating away on tears that never dry
Beneath the gray, where dreams go to die
In the silence, I hear echoes of pain
Floating in sorrow, caught in the rain

[verse]
Each step I take feels heavier still
The weight of emptiness, an unspoken chill
Voices whisper, but they fade so fast
Carried away by the winds of the past

[chorus]
Floating away on tears that never dry
Beneath the gray, where dreams go to die
In the silence, I hear echoes of pain
Floating in sorrow, caught in the rain

[bridge]
Time moves slow, yet moments slip away
Like sand between my fingers, they never stay
Hope drowns deep beneath the undertow
And I'm left here, with nowhere to go

[chorus]
Floating away on tears that never dry
Beneath the gray, where dreams go to die
In the silence, I hear echoes of pain
Floating in sorrow, caught in the rain

[outro]
So I'll float... forever lost in time
In this sea of sadness, no stars will shine
