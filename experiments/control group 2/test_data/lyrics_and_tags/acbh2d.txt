Lyrics :
[verse]
In the chaos of white noise, white noise
I find solace in the shadows of my mind

[chorus]
White lie, white lie
Cutting through the silence, cutting through the silence
Break me, break me
Till I'm nothing but a memory, a memory

[bridge]
Lost in the echoes of screams, of screams
Fighting against the tide, against the tide

[chorus]
White lie, white lie
Cutting through the silence, cutting through the silence
Save me, save me
From the darkness that consumes me, consumes me
