Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the rain
Knocking hard on my window pane
Every shadow whispered fear
But I've learned to face it all this year

[chorus]
I'm standing tall in the eye of the storm
No more running from the battles I've fought
With every scar, there's a story untold
And I'll rise above like warriors of old

[verse]
Heavy skies press down on me
But I carry the weight with dignity
Each step forward feels so wrong
Still, I march along, I'll prove them wrong

[chorus]
I'm standing tall in the eye of the storm
No more running from the battles I've fought
With every scar, there's a story untold
And I'll rise above like warriors of old

[bridge]
The night is dark but I see the light ahead
Through the cracks in the pavement where dreams are bred
Heartbeats loud, echoing through empty halls
This fight ain't over till the final call

[chorus]
I'm standing tall in the eye of the storm
No retreat now, no surrender in sight
With every scar, there's a fire that ignites
And I'll rise above like warriors of old
