User : 
I want a song that sounds like Lincoln Park, with some rhythmic sound effects at the start and end. The lyrics should be about addiction, maybe heroin or something similar. Can you do that?

[verse]
Woke up in a cold sweat again
The taste of metal on my lips
...
[chorus]
Heroin, you pull me under
A tide of needles and despair
In your arms, I lose myself
Sinking deeper, unaware

...and more.
