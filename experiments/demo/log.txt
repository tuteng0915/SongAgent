The strum pattern should be simple, and the song should be about a woman. It sounds like it would be performed by a solo artist rather than a band. There\'s a memorable part where the artist sings "she crazy," followed by a long, distinct falsetto that goes up and down. The style should be reminiscent of 70s-80s acoustic guitar music. Can you help me create something like this?', '8eelke'), kwargs = {}Error <class 'qwen_agent.llm.base.ModelServiceError'> occured:

Error message: Input data may contain inappropriate content., with args = ("Request to the Song Generating Agent:\n\nI need you to generate a modern French song based on a few vague details I remember. The song should revolve around the life of a man who feels trapped in his mundane routine, with lyrics that reflect his dissatisfaction and struggles, particularly at work where he faces issues like lack of promotion. The storyline should start with him driving his child, likely a girl, to school or someplace before heading to work. Thereâ€™s also a scene where he has dinner with neighbors, which adds a layer of social complexity to his life.\n\nAs the song progresses, it should delve into darker themes; perhaps the protagonist contemplates or commits an extreme act, such as harming himself or his family. This culminates in a dramatic scene where the neighbor discovers the aftermath, with a haunting implication that the tragedy might not end there.\n\nMusically, the tone should be reflective and melancholic, capturing both the banality and the underlying tension in the man's life. The style should align with contemporary French music, possibly incorporating elements of pop or chanson.\n\nPlease generate this song for me, including lyrics and relevant tags.\nTags: #FrenchSong #Modern #Melancholic #Dramatic", 'j7bahn'), kwargs = {}
