I'd like to generate a slow, soulful song in the style of Motown, but not the doo-wop by Maurice Williams. The lyrics should express deep affection, with lines like "baby I love you, I really love you," and feature harmonies where other singers repeat the word "stay." It should feel like it could be performed by a male vocal group, perhaps similar to The Temptations. Can you help me create this song?
