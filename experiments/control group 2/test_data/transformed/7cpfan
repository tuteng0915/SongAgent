Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits this description: it should have a 70s-80s rock vibe, featuring an instrument that sounds like a fairground organ or accordion. The tone of the song should be neutral—not too sad, but not overly happy either. It should feel repetitive and hypnotic in its structure. The singer should be male, with a youthful voice, sounding like he’s in his 20s or early 30s. Let’s create something unique based on these features!
