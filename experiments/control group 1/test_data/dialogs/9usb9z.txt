Sure thing! Let's start by focusing on the sound of the song. I'll aim for a slower tempo with a synth-heavy, rhythmic beat reminiscent of 80s electronic music. I'll also include some subtle background noise and consider adding guitar elements towards the end. For the vocals, we'll go with a male American singer. Does that sound good to start with? If so, I'll proceed to gather more details about the lyrics.

Great! I've set the sound parameters according to your preferences. Now, let's move on to the lyrics. Could you provide me with some themes or specific lines you'd like to include in the song? Once we have those, we can generate the song and proceed from there.
