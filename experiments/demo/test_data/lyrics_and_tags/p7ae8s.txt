Lyrics :
[verse]
Remember the days when we were young,
Dancing in the summer sun,
Barefoot on the sandy shore,
Our hearts beat like a drum.

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights,
Underneath the starry lights,
With you by my side,
Everything felt so right.

[verse]
Every moment was a treasure,
Innocence beyond measure,
We laughed until we cried,
With dreams that would never die.

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights,
Underneath the starry lights,
With you by my side,
Everything felt so right.

[bridge]
Though time has passed,
Those memories still last,
In my heart, they'll always stay,
Forever and a day.
