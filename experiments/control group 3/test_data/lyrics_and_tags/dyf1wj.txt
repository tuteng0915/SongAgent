Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
I grew up howling at the moon's soft glow,
In a world where only few would know,
The secret life of a wolf in disguise,
Finding my path through the starlit skies.

[Pre-Chorus]
Then one day, as fate would have it,
She appeared, like a dream, so vivid,
Her laughter was a melody pure and true,
In her eyes, a world anew.

[Chorus]
Oh, we dance under the silver light,
Two souls entwined in the night,
With every step, our hearts align,
Together we're wild, together we shine.

[Verse 2]
Through forest trails and city streets,
Our journey marked by love’s sweet beats,
Though the world may never understand,
The magic held within our hands.

[Bridge]
Life’s a tale of twists and turns,
Lessons learned and bridges burned,
But side by side, we face it all,
In this quirky world, we stand tall.

[Chorus]
Oh, we dance under the silver light,
Two souls entwined in the night,
With every step, our hearts align,
Together we're wild, together we shine.

[Outro]
Now we roam where the wild things are,
Guided by the brightest stars,
In this life, we’ve found our way,
Born to be free, come what may.
