Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I saw her face, so full of grace,
We danced through life, hand in hand,
Her laughter echoed across this land.

[chorus]
But now she's gone, my dearest friend,
And you're the reason her love will never end,
Oh son, remember her smile so wide,
In your heart, she'll always reside.

[verse]
Her illness came like a thief in the night,
Stealing moments, leaving us to fight,
But even in pain, her spirit shone,
A beacon of hope when all seemed gone.

[bridge]
Life teaches lessons sharp and true,
Love sometimes fades, but it renews,
Through every tear, there's strength to find,
In each goodbye, new loves unwind.

[chorus]
But now she's gone, my dearest friend,
And you're the reason her love will never end,
Oh son, remember her smile so wide,
In your heart, she'll always reside.

[outro]
Drums crash, guitars wail loud and free,
Piano weaves memories tenderly,
Hold on to these stories, let them guide,
For in them, forever she'll reside.
