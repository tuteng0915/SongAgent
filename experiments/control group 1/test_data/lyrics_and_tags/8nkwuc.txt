Lyrics :
[verse]
Rollin' down the street in my '64
Feelin' like a player, got my swagger on the floor
Got the beats bumpin', system's got the bass
Cruisin' through the hood, got a smile on my face

[chorus]
This is the sound that makes you nod your head
The rhythm's got you hooked, it's the G-funk thread
We keep it real, keep it funky, keep it fresh
With every single word, we're makin' it the best

[verse 2]
I'm rappin' to the beat, got the rhymes in my mind
Flow's so tight, gonna blow up your grind
From LA to the Bay, we keep it legit
Hip-hop's got the power, man, you know we commit

[bridge]
The synthesizers play, setting the scene
Smooth melodies flowing, like a dream unseen
It's all about the vibe, making moves with style
In this world of music, we go mile after mile

[chorus]
This is the sound that makes you nod your head
The rhythm's got you hooked, it's the G-funk thread
We keep it real, keep it funky, keep it fresh
With every single word, we're makin' it the best
