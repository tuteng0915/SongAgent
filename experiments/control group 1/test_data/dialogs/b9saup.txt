I'd like to create a modern country rock song that's catchy yet has some stereotypical and over-the-top elements. It should also have an overly produced sound. Can you work with that?

Alright, I've set up the parameters for your modern country rock song. It's catchy with some stereotypical and over-the-top elements, plus an overly produced sound just as you wanted. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Now I'm rolling down the highway
With my cowboy hat on high
I've got a truck full of troubles
But I'm feeling kinda fly

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun

[verse]
Got my guitar on my shoulder
And a song in my heart
Every little town I go to
Is where the party starts

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun

[bridge]
From the mountains to the valleys
To the rivers and the plains
Everyone's got a story
And I'm here to entertain

[chorus]
Cuz I'm a country rock star
Living life in a fancy car
With my boots and spurs on
I'll be singing this song till the morning sun
