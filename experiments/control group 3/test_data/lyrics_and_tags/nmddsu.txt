Lyrics :
[verse]
We're running through the fields of gold,
Chasing dreams that we've been told,
With every step, our spirits bold,
Together we'll never grow old.

[chorus]
Celebrate the bonds we share,
In this journey, everywhere,
Side by side, we'll always care,
Our friendship beyond compare.

[verse]
Underneath the starlit sky,
We laugh and dream as time goes by,
Hand in hand, we touch the high,
With hope and love, we'll never die.

[chorus]
Celebrate the bonds we share,
In this journey, everywhere,
Side by side, we'll always care,
Our friendship beyond compare.

[bridge]
Through the storms, we'll find our way,
With each dawn, a brighter day,
Dreams will guide us, come what may,
Together's where we'll always stay.

[chorus]
Celebrate the bonds we share,
In this journey, everywhere,
Side by side, we'll always care,
Our friendship beyond compare.
