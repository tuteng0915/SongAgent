Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been down this road before,
A one-way ticket to a small town lore.
But I ain't scared of what's ahead,
Got my boots on and my hat pulled tight instead.

[chorus]
Well that's fine by me, I'll take it all in stride,
With every mountain high, I'll reach the other side.
These open skies are calling out my name,
And I'm answering with fire, lighting up the flame.

[verse]
Guitar strings sing as I drive away,
From yesterday’s troubles to tomorrow's day.
No looking back, just dust in my rearview,
The rhythm of the highway is the only truth I knew.

[chorus]
Well that's fine by me, I'll ride the stormy weather,
Through the ups and downs, we’ll be together forever.
With every sunset fading into night,
We're chasing dreams under neon lights.

[bridge]
Oh, the wind is wild and free,
It whispers secrets only I can see.
Every heartbeat pounding like a drum,
This is where I belong, where I'm from.

[chorus]
Well that's fine by me, let the good times roll,
With a heart that's brave and an endless soul.
Underneath the vast and starry dome,
This life's a journey; our adventures will be home.
