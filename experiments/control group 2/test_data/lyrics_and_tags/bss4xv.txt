Lyrics :
[verse]
Rain falls in sheets on this dim-lit street
Your breath gets heavy, your words incomplete
I hold you closer, but it's not enough
The weight of the world feels so brutally tough

[chorus]
'You'll be okay,' were your last words to me
But how can I live when I'm the one to blame?
Flashing lights and the sound of regret
Echo through the dark as I try to forget

[verse]
The sirens wail while time stands still
Medics racing, but they never will
Fix what’s broken inside my head
A thousand could've-beens where love instead

[chorus]
'You'll be okay,' were your last words to me
But how can I live when I'm the one to blame?
Flashing lights and the sound of regret
Echo through the dark as I try to forget

[bridge]
Guitar solo with a melancholic tone
Every note bleeds out like it's carved in stone
This pain is mine; no one else can bear
The storm outside mirrors the void you left there

[chorus]
'You'll be okay,' but I won't ever be
These wounds run deeper than the eye can see
Flashing lights fade, but shadows remain
Haunted by the love that I couldn’t sustain

[outro]
Rain keeps falling, washing away
The life we had, the price that I pay
