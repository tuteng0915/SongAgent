Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a certain vibe I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want the song to capture that 2000's Vans Warped Tour energy—super high-energy, fast-paced with rapid drumming, and an overall pop-punk or emo feel. The lyrics should revolve around holding on to a past love, filled with nostalgia and maybe some longing. Oh, and at some point in the song, it would be cool if we could include the phrase “back back back” to give it that repetitive, anthemic quality.

Can you whip up something like this for me?

[verse]
Remember those summer nights
We'd chase the setting sun
Our hearts were wild and free
But now you're gone

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back

[verse]
These streets remain the same
But everything feels wrong
Without you by my side
Where did you go?

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back

[bridge]
The memories linger on
In every corner of this town
I'm searching for a way
To turn back time somehow

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back
