I would like a song with a mild tempo, similar to Enya's style but a bit faster and more cheerful. Could you create something along those lines?

[verse]
In the morning light I see
A world of dreams and fantasy
With every step that I take
I find a new path to awake

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm in my heart
Dancing to the music's art
Lift your voice and sing along
We'll make this world our own song

[verse]
Through the forest deep and wide
I wander free with joyful stride
The sun shines bright above my head
Guiding me where dreams are led

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm in my heart
Dancing to the music's art
Lift your voice and sing along
We'll make this world our own song

[bridge]
Let the melody take flight
On wings of hope through day and night
Together we will always be
In harmony like the rolling sea

[chorus]
Feel the rhythm in my heart
Dancing to the music's art
Lift your voice and sing along
We'll make this world our own song
