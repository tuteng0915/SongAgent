Lyrics :
[verse]
Driving down the endless road
Open skies above, feel so bold
Wheels keep turning, time unfolds
Chasing horizons, never growing old

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold

[verse]
The fairground lights flash by in the night
Accordion plays as we take flight
Hypnotic rhythms guide our way
Through the dawn of each brand new day

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold

[bridge]
In the rearview mirror, shadows fade
Forward is the only path we've made
Repetitive beats like a heartbeat's drum
Underneath the sun, where we all come from

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold
