Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding through the canyon with the sun on my back
Hear the rhythm of the horses as we walk the old track
Saddle creaking softly, boots are wearing thin
We ride for tomorrow, leave the past within

[chorus]
Oh, we're chasing horizons that never stand still
With a heart full of fire and an iron will
On this dusty trail, where shadows fall
We ride to the beat of the marching call

[verse]
Whiskey in my flask, stars above so wide
No need for riches when you’re by my side
The desert whispers secrets only we can hear
Each step takes us further from what held us near

[chorus]
Oh, we're chasing horizons that never stand still
With a heart full of fire and an iron will
On this dusty trail, where shadows fall
We ride to the beat of the marching call

[bridge]
The snare drum beats like a second heartbeat
Driving us forward, our journey complete
This rugged life, it’s all we know
Through endless plains, where wild winds blow

[chorus]
Oh, we're chasing horizons that never stand still
With a heart full of fire and an iron will
On this dusty trail, where shadows fall
We ride to the beat of the marching call

[outro]
So saddle up, partner, let's ride once more
To the edge of the world and perhaps beyond the door
Where legends are born and stories unfold
In the 60s rhythm, pure as aged gold
