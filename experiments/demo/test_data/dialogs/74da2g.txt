Let's aim for a celebratory and upbeat mood throughout the song, with no specific reflective or romantic sections. As for the genre, we're looking at a unique blend of 1920s Charleston and modern hip-hop. Does that sound good to you?

Now, let's move on to the lyrics. Here’s a draft of the song structure:

[Verse]
In the roaring twenties, we dance and we sing,
Feathers and flappers, let the good times swing.
Brass bands playing hot, under moonlit skies,
Every step we take, in rhythm we fly high.

[Chorus]
Oh, we’re jumping, jiving, feeling so alive,
Charleston beats with a hip-hop drive.
Raise your hands up, let the music play,
Celebrating every single day.

[Bridge]
From the past to the present, we blend and collide,
Speakeasy vibes with a modern stride.
Syncopated rhythms, breaking all the rules,
Dancing through the night, setting the town ablaze.

[Chorus]
Oh, we’re jumping, jiving, feeling so alive,
Charleston beats with a hip-hop drive.
Raise your hands up, let the music play,
Celebrating every single day.
