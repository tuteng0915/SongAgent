[verse]
I've been walking down this lonely road
Feeling the weight of the world unfold
Searching for a light in the dark
Trying to leave my mark

[chorus]
Oh, let the rhythm take control
Feel the beat, let it feed your soul
Dancing through the night, we'll never grow old
In this world of rock and roll

[verse]
Every heartbeat tells a story deep
Notes of passion that we long to keep
Through the highs and lows, we lose and find
Melodies that bind us, intertwined

[chorus]
Oh, let the rhythm take control
Feel the beat, let it feed your soul
Dancing through the night, we'll never grow old
In this world of rock and roll

[bridge]
From Detroit's streets to the delta's moan
The pulse of life in every tone
We sing our truth, let the music console
In this eternal dance of rock and roll

[chorus]
Oh, let the rhythm take control
Feel the beat, let it feed your soul
Dancing through the night, we'll never grow old
In this world of rock and roll
