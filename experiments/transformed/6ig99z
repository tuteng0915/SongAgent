Hey there! I’d like you to generate a rock song based on the following requirements:  

- The chorus should repeat a key phrase about three times, and it needs to include something along the lines of "why do you wanna die."  
- It’s sung by a male vocalist with a clean guitar intro—nothing too heavy, no distortion at first—and it builds into a full rock vibe later.  
- Keep it emotional and raw, staying true to rock ballad vibes.  

Can you work your magic and create something that fits this description?
