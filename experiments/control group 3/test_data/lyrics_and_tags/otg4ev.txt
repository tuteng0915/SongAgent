Lyrics :
[verse 1]
In the quiet hours, where whispers dwell,
I talk to you as if time forgot to tell,
Your laughter lingers in each empty room,
A haunting melody, our love's sweet perfume.

[chorus]
Oh my dear, though shadows veil your face,
In every corner, I still trace your grace,
Is it you who answers when I softly call?
Or just the echoes playing tricks on us all?

[verse 2]
Our garden grows wild with dreams untold,
Yet without you, colors fade to gray and cold,
Each flower blooms with whispers of your name,
In silent nights, nothing's quite the same.

[chorus]
Oh my dear, though shadows veil your face,
In every corner, I still trace your grace,
Is it you who answers when I softly call?
Or just the echoes playing tricks on us all?

[bridge]
Between reality and dreams I sway,
Holding onto whispers that won't stay,
The line blurs, where does truth lie?
In the warmth of memories or the tears I cry?

[chorus]
Oh my dear, though shadows veil your face,
In every corner, I still trace your grace,
Is it you who answers when I softly call?
Or just the echoes playing tricks on us all?
