Lyrics :
[Verse]
In a room where time stands still,
An old man lies, his heart to fill.
Memories fade, yet dreams persist,
A life once lived, now misted twist.

[Chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The days we danced through it all.
With every heartbeat, with every breath,
We march ahead, defying death.

[Bridge]
And as she enters, singing clear,
Her voice ignites what was held dear.
Flashbacks flood, a vivid stream,
Of battles fought and love supreme.
