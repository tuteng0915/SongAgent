Lyrics :
[chorus]
Rise up from the ashes, let your spirit soar,
In the darkest night, find the lion's roar,
With every heartbeat, break through the chains,
Feel the fire burning, ignite the flames.

[verse]
Walking through shadows, where light seldom shines,
Carrying burdens, yet seeking the signs,
A whisper of courage amidst all despair,
Guiding us forward, when hope seems rare.
