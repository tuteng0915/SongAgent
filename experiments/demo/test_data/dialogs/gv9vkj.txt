User : 
I'd like a song with a smooth, synthetic vibe and minimal percussion. Think electronic keyboard with soft, melodic tones. Can we work on that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To ensure the song aligns with your preferences, let me gather some more details. Do you have any specific themes or emotions in mind for the lyrics? Also, should the tempo be slow, moderate, or fast?

Once we have these details, I'll generate the initial tags and lyrics for the song.

It looks like we need to define your preferences a bit more. Since you're aiming for a smooth, synthetic vibe with minimal percussion, how do you feel about exploring themes of introspection or perhaps a serene love story in the lyrics? Additionally, would you prefer the tempo to be slow and soothing, or should it carry a bit more energy with a moderate pace?

Let me know your thoughts so I can proceed with generating the tags and lyrics accordingly.
User : 
Let's go with introspection and a slow, soothing tempo. Something dreamy and ethereal.

[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I wander through my mind
A dreamscape unfolds, where shadows gently collide

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie

[verse]
Echoes of memories, in the silence they sing
Guiding me gently, through this journey within

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie

[bridge]
In this ethereal dance, time fades away
Only the moment remains, in this introspective ballet

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie
