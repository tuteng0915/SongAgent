Lyrics :
[verse]
I wake up every morning with the sunlight in my eyes
There's a rhythm in my heartbeat that just makes me wanna rise

[chorus]
Feel the beat, it's our time to shine
Dancing through the night, everything's fine
Lift your hands up high, let the music play
We're gonna dance until the break of day

[verse]
Every step we take is like a move in a perfect line
Got the energy flowing, there's no need to confine

[chorus]
Feel the beat, it's our time to shine
Dancing through the night, everything's fine
Lift your hands up high, let the music play
We're gonna dance until the break of day

[bridge]
Together we unite, under the neon lights
In this moment, everything feels so right

[chorus]
Feel the beat, it's our time to shine
Dancing through the night, everything's fine
Lift your hands up high, let the music play
We're gonna dance until the break of day
