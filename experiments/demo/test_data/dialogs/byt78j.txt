User : 
I'd like a dreamy, synth-heavy song with a minimalist vibe and a repeating chorus that goes something like "... to take the pain away." Can you work with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can work with that. Let's flesh out some more details to make this song truly come to life. Since you want a dreamy and synth-heavy track with a minimalist vibe, I assume you're leaning towards an electronic genre. Do you have any preferences for the tempo or specific instruments you'd like to feature besides synths? 

Also, could you provide me with more lyrics for the verses or any particular themes you'd like to explore in the song? Once we have these details, we'll be ready to generate the song.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since we haven't established any further preferences yet, I'll go ahead and set some initial tags for our song based on the information you've provided. I'll also draft an example verse along with the repeating chorus you suggested.

For the tags, I'll choose: `dreamy, synth-heavy, minimalist, electronic`.

And for the lyrics, I'll create a simple structure like this:

```
[verse]
In the silence of the night,
I find my way to the light,
It's a journey through the haze,
To escape, to drift away.

[chorus]
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.

[verse]
Whispers softly through the air,
A gentle touch, a fleeting care,
In the echoes of the day,
We search, we yearn, we sway.

[chorus]
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
```

Once you're ready, press the "generate" button to manually generate the song with these settings.
