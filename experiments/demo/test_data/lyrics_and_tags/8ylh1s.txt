Lyrics :
[verse]
Living in the echo of a forgotten dream,
where shadows dance and streetlights gleam.
Violin whispers on a concrete stage,
cello's deep voice, turning another page.

In streets where brothers are falling fast,
guns speak louder than words that last.
A cycle of pain, it endlessly turns,
when will we learn, when will we change?

[chorus]
In this life, we rise, we fall,
searching for meaning in it all.
Echoes of wisdom, strings that bind,
in the rhythm of time, find your mind.

[verse]
Stories told through the strings that play,
each note a lesson, each beat a way.
Through the alleys of the city's soul,
a conscious path is the ultimate goal.

[bridge]
Underneath the stars, we question why,
the music leads us as moments fly.
A tapestry woven with threads of sound,
in every corner, answers are found.

Guns blazing fire, hearts made of stone,
one brother's loss, is everyone's own.
We cry, we fight, in the dead of night,
hope flickers like a candle's light.

[chorus]
In this life, we rise, we fall,
searching for meaning in it all.
Echoes of wisdom, strings that bind,
in the rhythm of time, find your mind.
