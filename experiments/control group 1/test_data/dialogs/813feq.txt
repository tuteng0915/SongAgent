User : 
I'm excited to help create your song! To start, could you tell me a bit more about the theme or message you'd like the lyrics to convey? Something positive and uplifting, perhaps?
Agent : 
Sure thing! Let's aim for a theme that's positive and uplifting. How about we create a song that celebrates personal growth and overcoming challenges? I'll go ahead and set some initial tags and lyrics for this theme.

I'll call the `preference` function to understand your preferences better, and then I'll use the `param_setter` tool to set the tags and lyrics.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences yet, I'll proceed with a general set of tags that usually fit an uplifting and positive theme. Let's get started on those lyrics and tags.

Successfully set the parameter lyrics
I've set the tags and lyrics for your song. The theme is about celebrating personal growth and overcoming challenges, which should be reflected in both the lyrics and the tags.

Remember to press the "generate" button to manually generate the song. After you hear it, we can make any adjustments or refinements you feel are necessary. How does that sound?
