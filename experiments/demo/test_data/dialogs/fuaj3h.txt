Sure, I can create a song that fits your description. To make it more personalized, could you tell me what kind of themes or specific elements you'd like in the lyrics? For example, any particular emotions or stories you want to express?
User : 
The lyrics should be about feeling numb or maybe struggling to move or breathe. Something that really captures those emotions, you know?

I've crafted some lyrics that delve into the emotions of feeling numb and struggling. Here's a preview:

[Verse]
Feeling so numb, like I'm frozen in time,
Every breath is a battle, every move is a climb.

[Chorus]
I'm lost in the silence, can't find my way out,
The world keeps spinning but I'm standing in doubt.

[Bridge]
Shadows whisper, they pull me under,
In this cold place, I keep on wondering.
