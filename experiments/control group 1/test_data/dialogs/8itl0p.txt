I want a rock song with dubstep elements, especially in the chorus. It should feel like it's from around 2012 and have a sense of breaking free. Can you work with that?

I've tailored a rock song with dubstep elements for you, capturing that 2012 vibe with a powerful sense of breaking free. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
I've been down this road for far too long
Walking in shadows, where the lights don't belong
But tonight, I'll break these chains that bind
Feel the rush, leave the past behind

[chorus]
Break it down, let the walls come crashing in
Dubstep drops, feel the bass within
We're rising up, like a phoenix from the flame
In this moment, we are not the same

... [additional lyrics omitted for brevity]
