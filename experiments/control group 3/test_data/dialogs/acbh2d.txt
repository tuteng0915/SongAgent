I want a fast-paced metal/rock song with a raw, emotional vibe. It should include "white lie," "white line," or "white noise" repeated twice in a row. Can you add another word repeated twice after that?

Let's go with "white lie, white lie" and use "chaos, chaos" for the repeated word. Keep the themes and feelings intense and chaotic.

I've created a fast-paced metal/rock song with a raw and emotional vibe, incorporating the phrases "white lie, white lie" and "chaos, chaos" as you requested. The themes are intense and chaotic, reflecting the feelings you want to convey.

Here's a snippet of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
In the heart of chaos, chaos
A white lie, a white lie spoken in vain
Riding on the edge of a white line, white line

[chorus]
White noise drowns out the pain, the pain
In a world gone mad, mad with desire
Chaos, chaos reigns over the sane
We're all living a white lie, white lie

[bridge]
Through the storm of static, static and fear
Truth is but a whisper, lost in the white noise, white noise

[chorus]
White noise drowns out the pain, the pain
In a world gone mad, mad with desire
Chaos, chaos reigns over the sane
We're all living a white lie, white lie
```
