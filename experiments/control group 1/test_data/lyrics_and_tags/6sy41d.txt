Lyrics :
[verse] In the quiet of the morning light, I strum my ukulele with delight. The world is still, just you and me, Beneath the vast and endless sky.

[chorus] Oh, we sing, our voices blend, High above the world we ascend. With every note, with every string, Our hearts take flight on love's soft wings.

[verse] Through the gentle breeze that sways, We dance together in a sweet array. Your laughter like a melody, In this moment, we are free.

[chorus] Oh, we sing, our voices blend, High above the world we ascend. With every note, with every string, Our hearts take flight on love's soft wings.

[bridge] And when the night falls down, We'll keep the music playing all around. Underneath the starlit skies, Together we create lullabies.

[chorus] Oh, we sing, our voices blend, High above the world we ascend. With every note, with every string, Our hearts take flight on love's soft wings.
