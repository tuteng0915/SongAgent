Alright, let's transform this into a request for the song-generating agent.

**My Request:**  
I want you to generate a song that captures the essence of 90s East Coast Hip-Hop. The lyrics should include the line *"…from the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver…"*. The beat needs to be boom bap-style, with that classic 90s gritty and soulful vibe. Keep it authentic to the era while giving it your own creative twist. Let’s go!
