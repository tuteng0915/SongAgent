Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate a song that starts with a scene of an old man lying in a hospital bed. Suddenly, a woman bursts in, singing "Do you remember" accompanied by a marching band. The song should then transition into flashbacks, perhaps showing scenes of dancing on a hillside, while still featuring the old man in his hospital bed or wheelchair. The overall sound and style should be very similar to Florence and the Machine. 

Please generate this song for me.
