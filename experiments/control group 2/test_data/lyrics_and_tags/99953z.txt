Lyrics :
[verse]
Dancing in the twilight, neon colors in the air,
Weâ€™re chasing shadows, moving without a care.

[chorus]
Sunset melodies take us higher,
Empire lights, they ignite the fire.
In this moment, we own the night,
With every beat, our spirits alight.

[verse]
Golden waves crash under moonlit skies,
Electric dreams in our eyes.

[chorus]
Sunset melodies take us higher,
Empire lights, they ignite the fire.
In this moment, we own the night,
With every beat, our spirits alight.

[bridge]
As the night fades to grey,
The rhythm takes us away.

[outro]
Now the tempo slows, with a gentle breeze,
A saxophone whispers through the trees.
