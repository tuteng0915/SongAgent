Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The streets are empty, they're calling my name
I'm losing track of who I used to be
There's something whispering inside of me

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

[verse]
Faded dreams on the edge of town
Silent screams getting louder now
Alien signals, they call to me
In this strange land, where nothing is free

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

[bridge]
The struggle is real when I'm face to face
With shadows of doubt that I can't erase
But I'll find my way through this mystery
Even as you keep on controlling me

[chorus]
You've got me spinning round, lost in your eyes
Every step I take, you're controlling me
I try to break free but you hold the key
In this world of chaos, you're controlling me

[outro]
Amongst the stars, I see your face
An alien grace, I'm lost in space
Forever bound by unseen ties
In this cosmic dance, you're controlling me
