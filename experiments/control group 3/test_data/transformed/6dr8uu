Hello, Song Agent! I'd like you to generate a song based on some specific requirements. The song should be in the style of an American pop song from the 90s or early 2000s. It should include a part where the singer overhears people gossiping in another room and angrily sings something about "doesn't anybody close their doors anymore." Can you create such a song for me? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
