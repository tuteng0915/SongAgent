I want a song that gives off that early 2000s or late 90s vibe. Can you do that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create a song with an early 2000s or late 90s vibe. To make sure it fits your expectations, could you tell me more about what specific elements or styles from that era you'd like to include in the song? For example, do you prefer pop, rock, or another genre? Any particular themes or lyrics you'd like to explore?


the user has not given their preferences yet.
To better tailor the song to your liking, could you share some of your musical preferences? Such as your favorite artists or songs from that time, or any specific themes like love, nostalgia, or party vibes you want the song to convey?
User : 
I think I want it to be pop, but not too sure about the theme. Maybe something about love? Can you show me some lyrics first?

Here are the lyrics for a song that captures an early 2000s or late 90s pop vibe with a theme of love:

[verse]
Remember the days when we were young,
Dancing in the summer sun,
Barefoot on the sandy shore,
Our hearts beat like a drum.

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights,
Underneath the starry lights,
With you by my side,
Everything felt so right.

[verse]
Every moment was a treasure,
Innocence beyond measure,
We laughed until we cried,
With dreams that would never die.

[chorus]
Oh, those summer nights,
Underneath the starry lights,
With you by my side,
Everything felt so right.

[bridge]
Though time has passed,
Those memories still last,
In my heart, they'll always stay,
Forever and a day.

The lyrics are nice, but can we make it sound more computer-generated? Like those old-school virtual voices? And maybe add some random video shots for the video concept?
