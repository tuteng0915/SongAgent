Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the street, feeling that beat
Every step I take, my worries abate
In this moment, life is so sweet
Got my headphones on, hear the music play

[chorus]
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Dancing through the night, letting my spirits flow
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Gonna keep it up, riding that tempo

[bridge]
Underneath the neon lights, everything feels right
I'm losing track of time, just moving with the vibe
There ain't no place I'd rather be, yeah, you feel me?
Just a soul on the loose, caught up in the groove
