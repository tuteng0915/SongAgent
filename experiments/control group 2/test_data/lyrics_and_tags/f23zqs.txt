Lyrics :
[verse]
I see your face in every star
That shines above in skies afar
With every step, my heart unfolds
A love so pure, a tale untold

[chorus]
You're the dream I hold so tight
My guiding light through endless night
In your arms, I've found my home
Together we will never roam

[verse]
Our whispers dance in quiet breeze
Beneath the moon, beneath the trees
Each word you speak, it lingers near
A sweet refrain for us to hear

[chorus]
You're the dream I hold so tight
My guiding light through endless night
In your arms, I've found my home
Together we will never roam

[bridge]
Every moment, every day
With you, my love will never sway
The world may turn, seasons may change
But our story stays rearranged

[chorus]
You're the dream I hold so tight
My guiding light through endless night
In your arms, I've found my home
Together we will never roam

[outro]
So here's my heart, my soul, my all
With you, I'll never have to fall
