Lyrics :
[verse]
I walked a lonely road
Regretting every step I've known
The echoes of the past remain
In shadows, they eternally stay

[chorus]
Oh Cha Ha Change
It's just a cruel refrain
Bound by these chains
Of choices left in the rain

[verse]
The weight upon my chest
A heavy stone, I can't contest
Memories linger like a stain
In the theater of my pain

[chorus]
Oh Cha Ha Change
A haunting serenade
Bound by these chains
Where silence and sorrow are lain
