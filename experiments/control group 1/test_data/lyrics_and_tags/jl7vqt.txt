Lyrics :
[verse]
Through the echoes of time, we sail
In search of dreams that never fail
A thousand stars light up our way
Guiding us through night and day

[chorus]
Oh, the places we'll go
On this journey, we'll grow
With every step, a new story unfolds
In this vast universe, brave and bold

[verse]
Ancient whispers in the breeze
Memories of lands across the seas
The past and future intertwine
In the dance of the endless line

[chorus]
Oh, the places we'll go
On this journey, we'll grow
With every step, a new story unfolds
In this vast universe, brave and bold

[bridge]
From the mountains high to the ocean wide
We'll chase the horizon, side by side
In the heart of the storm, we'll find our way
Together we'll rise, together we'll stay

[chorus]
Oh, the places we'll go
On this journey, we'll grow
With every step, a new story unfolds
In this vast universe, brave and bold
