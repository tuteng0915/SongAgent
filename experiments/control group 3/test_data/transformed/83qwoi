Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some details I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should feel like a 90’s pop ballad, sung by a female artist, and could fit as part of a movie soundtrack. The chorus needs to be catchy with an "ohhhhhhhh"/"oh-ohhhhhh" kind of vibe, followed by three short lines that are almost identical except for the last one, which ends slightly higher in pitch. It would also be great if it had that nostalgic, timeless quality that makes it memorable.  

Can you help me create something like this?
