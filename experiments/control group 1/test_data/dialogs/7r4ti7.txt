I’d like a song with an emotional arc—starting urgent, moving to happiness, then tension and heartbreak, ending hauntingly. Could you start working on that?

Sure, I can create a song based on the emotional arc you've described. Since I don't have your specific preferences on file, I'll use a general set of tags that fit the emotions you're looking for: urgency, happiness, tension, heartbreak, and haunting. Let's proceed with generating the lyrics and setting the appropriate tags.

I will now set the tags and generate the initial lyrics.

I've generated the initial lyrics and set the tags for your song based on the emotional arc you requested. Here's a preview of the sections:

[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I call your name
Running through shadows, consumed by the pain

[chorus]
We rise, we fall together
In this moment, there's no fear
Our laughter fills the silence
And chases all the ghosts so clear

[verse]
But now the sky is dark and heavy with rain
Promises broken like fragile glass panes

[chorus]
Tension grows, hearts collide in vain
The echoes of love lost, they chain

[bridge]
Shattered dreams under moonlit skies
Heartbreak paints a tearful goodbye

[chorus]
In the haunting whispers of the breeze
I hear your voice, memories freeze

[outro]
A lingering specter of what we had
Haunting steps on a desolate path
