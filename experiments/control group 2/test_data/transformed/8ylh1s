Hey there, song generating agent! I've got a challenge for you. I want you to generate a hip hop song that captures the essence of the early 90s. The beat should feature a sample from a string section, maybe a violin or cello, with a rhythm that goes "dah (rest) dah dah dah dah (rest) dah dah dah dah." The song should be performed by a male emcee and have a "conscious" theme, where the rapper talks about the unfortunate reality of people shooting each other. Let's see what you can come up with!
