Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, stepping in the spotlight, ready to ignite,
Feel the energy surge, taking flight tonight.
Unstoppable force, no limits in sight,
With every rhyme I drop, I'm winning this fight.

[chorus]
We unstoppable, turning heads as we roll through,
Empowered and alive, there's nothing we can't do.
Feel the beat, catch the vibe, it's a state of mind,
In this moment, we're free, leaving fears behind.

[verse]
Mic in hand, confidence on full display,
Breaking down barriers, paving my way.
Riding the rhythm, riding the wave,
Every challenge we face, together we'll brave.

[bridge]
From the shadows emerge, stepping into the light,
Shining bright, setting the night alight.
Hype in the air, can you feel the call?
Together we rise, never destined to fall.

[chorus]
We unstoppable, turning heads as we roll through,
Empowered and alive, there's nothing we can't do.
Feel the beat, catch the vibe, it's a state of mind,
In this moment, we're free, leaving fears behind.
