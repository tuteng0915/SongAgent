Lyrics :
[verse]
In the haze of neon lights,
I'm a shadow lost in the crowd tonight.
Every laugh and every shout,
Fades away as I walk in doubt.

[chorus]
But I dance alone, heart on the floor,
Searching for something I can't ignore.
In this room full of strangers' stares,
I find my rhythm, shake off my fears.

[verse]
Underneath the glittering sky,
Silent tears reflect in my eye.
They don't see the world through my lens,
To them, it’s just Friday night again.

[chorus]
Still I dance alone, heart on the floor,
Hoping one day I’ll find what I’m searching for.
Amongst these fleeting faces and glares,
I hold onto hope, breathe through despair.

[bridge]
Maybe tomorrow I'll belong,
Find where I fit, find where I’m strong.
Until then, I keep moving along,
With every beat, I prove myself wrong.

[chorus]
Yes, I dance alone, but not for long,
There’s a melody where I truly belong.
And though tonight I stand unpaired,
Each step I take brings me somewhere.
