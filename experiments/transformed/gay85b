Hello, song agent! I have a unique request for you. Instead of finding a song, I would like you to generate one based on the following details:  

I'm looking for a recent song in the alternative/alternative rock style that tells the story of a city doomed to be destroyed in a year. The people in this city are fully aware of their impending fate. One of the key lyrics should convey something along the lines of "the kids don't go to school, there's simply nothing left to learn."  

Could you create a song with these features? Thank you so much for your help!
