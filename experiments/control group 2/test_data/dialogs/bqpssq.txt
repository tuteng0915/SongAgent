Hey, song agent! I need your help to generate a song that matches these details. The song should have an indie rock vibe and feel like it was released in the last five years. The lyrics should convey a heartfelt message where the singer reassures their mom and sister not to be sad because they'll be with their father. Can you create something based on this?

Lyrics:
```
[verse]
Mom and sis, don't you cry
I'll be with dad in the sky
We'll watch over you each day
In every step, in every way

[chorus]
I'm not gone, just moved on
To a place where we belong
With love that never fades
In your heart, I am stayed

[verse]
Though it seems life's come to an end
Remember, love will never bend
Keep me close, within your soul
And you'll find me in every goal

[chorus]
I'm not gone, just moved on
To a place where we belong
With love that never fades
In your heart, I am stayed

[bridge]
Time may pass, but know this truth
Our bond is ageless, eternal proof
Feel my love, like a gentle breeze
Carrying whispers through the trees

[chorus]
I'm not gone, just moved on
To a place where we belong
With love that never fades
In your heart, I am stayed
