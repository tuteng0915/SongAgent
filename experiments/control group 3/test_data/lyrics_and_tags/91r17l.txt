Lyrics :
[verse]
Under neon lights we move as one,
Shadows dancing, till the night is done.
Step to the rhythm, let it take control,
In this moment, we find our soul.

[chorus]
Dance through time, across the floor,
Eras blend, and we want more.
With every step, a story told,
In the dance of dreams, we never grow old.

[verse]
From disco balls to futuristic beams,
We glide in sync with shared dreams.
Electric pulses guide our feet,
In this fusion, past and future meet.

[chorus]
Dance through time, across the floor,
Eras blend, and we want more.
With every step, a story told,
In the dance of dreams, we never grow old.

[bridge]
Glowing lights, they paint the air,
A tapestry of moments rare.
Feel the beat, let it set you free,
In this dance, find your destiny.

[chorus]
Dance through time, across the floor,
Eras blend, and we want more.
With every step, a story told,
In the dance of dreams, we never grow old.
