Lyrics :
[verse]
We've walked together down these streets
In every weather, love never retreats

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away

[verse]
Countless memories light up our days
With you, life's a joyous parade

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away

[bridge]
Like a songbird singing in the morning dew
Our hearts keep the rhythm, fresh and new

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away
