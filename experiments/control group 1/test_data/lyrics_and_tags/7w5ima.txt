Lyrics :
[verse]
In the darkness, I'm losing my way
The shadows whisper, they call me to stay

[chorus]
Rescue me... I'm drowning
In this sea of despair
Bring me back to the surface
And show me that you care

[verse]
Every step feels so heavy and cold
The weight of the world on my shoulders unfold

[chorus]
Rescue me... I'm drowning
In this sea of despair
Bring me back to the surface
And show me that you care

[bridge]
I reach for the light, but it fades away
Will I find a new dawn after this darkest day?

[chorus]
Rescue me... I'm drowning
In this sea of despair
Bring me back to the surface
And show me that you care
