Lyrics :
[verse 1]
Stacking cold cuts on the daily grind,
Serving customers, but our hearts aren't confined.
By day we slice, by night we play,
In the basement club where secrets lay.

[chorus]
The lights are low, the music calls,
We trade our aprons for the shadows and thrills.
Nobody knows about our double lives,
But tonight feels different—danger arrives.

[verse 2]
There she stands in her disguise,
Our singer, the voice that hypnotizes.
Her sultry tone takes control of the room,
But little do we know her true doom looms.

[bridge]
Footsteps echo, it's not just sound,
Red and blue lights flash all around.
The gig is up, the stage goes dark,
A cop reveals herself, tears us apart.

[chorus]
The lights are high, the music stops,
No more applause, no more bops.
The crowd scatters, dreams undone,
Betrayed by the one beneath the neon sun.

[outro]
She was sent to find what lies beneath,
To shut down our nights and clip our leash.
The deli by day, the club by night—
All gone now, lost in the fight.
