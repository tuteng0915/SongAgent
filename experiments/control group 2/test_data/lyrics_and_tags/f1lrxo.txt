Lyrics :
[verse]
I woke up with a bucket on my head
To keep the zombies from eating my brains
It's a fashion statement and a life saver
In this crazy world that's going insane

[chorus]
We're the kids who never say die
With our hearts on our sleeves and our hopes in the sky
We'll fight till the end, we'll never conform
We are the rebels, we are the storm

[verse]
Our parents don't understand us
They think we're lost in this masquerade
But we've found ourselves in the chaos
And we're not afraid to be afraid

[chorus]
We're the kids who never say die
With our hearts on our sleeves and our hopes in the sky
We'll fight till the end, we'll never conform
We are the rebels, we are the storm

[bridge]
So put your buckets on
Let's dance in the rain
We'll laugh at the storm
And embrace the pain

[chorus]
We're the kids who never say die
With our hearts on our sleeves and our hopes in the sky
We'll fight till the end, we'll never conform
We are the rebels, we are the storm
