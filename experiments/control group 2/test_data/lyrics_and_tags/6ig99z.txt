Lyrics :
[verse]
I saw you standing in the rain last night
Your shadow fading under neon lights
The echoes of your footsteps filled the air
But I could feel there was no one there

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[verse]
There's a fire burning deep inside your soul
But you keep pushing everyone away, losing control
I hear your voice—it's screaming through the pain
But silence answers every time again

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[bridge]
The storm will pass, and skies will clear
But only if you face what brought you here
Hold on tight, don't let go now
This is your fight, take that vow

[chorus]
Why do you wanna die, why do you wanna cry?
Why do you let it all slip away this time?
Why do you wanna die, why won't you even try?
You've got so much left to give, don't say goodbye
Why do you wanna die?

[outro]
So let the tears fall down tonight
Let the world feel heavy as you fight
But remember who you used to be
Alive with dreams—just let them free
