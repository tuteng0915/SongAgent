Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the street in my worn-out sneakers
Leather jacket on, with dreams so much bigger
In this small town where nothing ever happens
I feel the world's weight but I carry on dancing

[chorus]
Oh, and the seasons chaaahange!
But some things always stay the same
Underneath the neon lights
We find our truth, we ignite

[verse]
Memories echo as we're growing older
Stories untold, secrets that we hold her
Every heartbeat is a drum that's calling
For the courage to keep on falling

[chorus]
Oh, and the seasons chaaahange!
But some things always stay the same
Underneath the neon lights
We find our truth, we ignite

[bridge]
And when the night falls
And all the stars align
We'll sing our song once more
With love and pain entwined

[chorus]
Oh, and the seasons chaaahange!
But some things always stay the same
Underneath the neon lights
We find our truth, we ignite

[outro]
So let the music play
As we dance into the greying day
With every step we take
Our hearts will never break
