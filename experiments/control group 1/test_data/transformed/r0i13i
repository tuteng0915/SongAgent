Hey there! I've got this song stuck in my head that feels like it’s from the 80s or early 90s, and it’s super upbeat—like a dance/disco vibe. It reminds me a lot of Stevie Wonder's style. The part I remember sounds like the chorus starting with “you’ve got to break (pause) through.” Since I can’t seem to find it anywhere, could you help me generate a song like that? Something with those lyrics and energy would be amazing!
