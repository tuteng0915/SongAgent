I'm excited to help you create your pop punk song! To start, could you tell me a bit more about the main theme or emotion you'd like to convey?
Agent : 
Sure! Pop punk is a great genre for expressing raw emotion and relatable themes. Could you share if there's a particular feeling or story you want to focus on? For instance, we could explore themes like youthful rebellion, heartbreak, friendship, or even just having fun. Once I have an idea of the theme, I can suggest some fitting tags and begin drafting lyrics.

In the meantime, I'll go ahead and set some initial tags that are common in pop punk music.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences yet, I'll start by suggesting some general tags that fit well within the pop punk genre. Let's go with:

- Energetic
- Melodic
- Youthful
- Catchy

Once you provide more details about the theme or emotion you'd like to convey, I can refine these tags and start working on the lyrics.

Please share your thoughts when you're ready!
