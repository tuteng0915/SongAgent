Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song for me. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should have some piano in it and be fast-paced. The main singer should sound a bit like Kenny Loggins, and there should be background singers adding harmony. The hook of the song should go something like "C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon in love."  

Can you create that for me?
