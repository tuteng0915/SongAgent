Lyrics :
[verse]
I'm standing in the crowd, but I feel so alone
Neon lights flash, but they're not my home
Smiling on the outside, breaking on the inside
This isn't where I belong, but I stay to survive

[chorus]
Dancing in the dark, faking every move
Lost in the beat, but it's not my groove
Wishing I could leave, but I play along
Caught in this moment, where I don't belong

[verse]
Shadows on the wall, hiding all my fears
Music fills the air, drowning out my tears
I keep up appearances, a mask on my face
But deep down, I just want to break free from this place

[chorus]
Dancing in the dark, faking every move
Lost in the beat, but it's not my groove
Wishing I could leave, but I play along
Caught in this moment, where I don't belong

[bridge]
The night feels endless, spinning out of control
I try to find meaning in the chaos that unfolds
But every step I take keeps leading me astray
Will I ever find my way back? Or will I always stay?

[chorus]
Dancing in the dark, faking every move
Lost in the beat, but it's not my groove
Wishing I could leave, but I play along
Caught in this moment, where I don't belong

[outro]
As the music fades, and the lights grow dim
I slip away quietly, escaping within
Back to who I am, away from the show
Leaving behind the illusion, letting my true self flow
