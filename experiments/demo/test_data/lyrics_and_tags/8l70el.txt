Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the storm, I stand my ground,
Facing the waves, not a trace of doubt.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, to the sky so high,
With hope in our hearts, we'll touch the sky.
Together we march, through the darkest night,
With the dawn in our eyes, everything's alright.

[verse]
Every stumble's a lesson, every fall's a gain,
Building from the ashes, setting free the pain.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, to the sky so high,
With hope in our hearts, we'll touch the sky.
Together we march, through the darkest night,
With the dawn in our eyes, everything's alright.

[bridge - voicemail style]
Hey... just wanted to say, no matter how tough it gets, keep pushing forward. The sun will shine again, and weâ€™ll be stronger for it. Leave your fears behind, take that step. We're in this together.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, to the sky so high,
With hope in our hearts, we'll touch the sky.
Together we march, through the darkest night,
With the dawn in our eyes, everything's alright.
