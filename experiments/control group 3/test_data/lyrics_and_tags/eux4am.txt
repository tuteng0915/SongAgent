Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the evening
I remember your smile
The way the sunlight danced upon your face
And for a moment, I'm lost in time

[chorus]
Oh, how I miss those days
When love was all we had to give away
Our hearts entwined in bittersweet embrace
A melody of us, now just a trace

[verse]
The echoes of our laughter
Still linger in the air
Though you're gone, your shadow softly lingers there

[chorus]
Oh, how I miss those days
When love was all we had to give away
Our hearts entwined in bittersweet embrace
A melody of us, now just a trace

[bridge]
But even as the nights grow cold
And memories begin to fade
I hold on to what we had
A love that time can't ever take

[chorus]
Oh, how I miss those days
When love was all we had to give away
Our hearts entwined in bittersweet embrace
A melody of us, now just a trace

[outro]
In this silent reverie
I find you once again
Lost in the echoes of our symphony
