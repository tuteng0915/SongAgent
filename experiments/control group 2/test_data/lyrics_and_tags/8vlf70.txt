Lyrics :
[verse]
In the night, lights are bright, moving to the rhythm of the beat
Feel the bass, it's a test, lose yourself within the heat

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say

[verse]
Underneath the neon glow, shadows dance, they come and go
Echoes of a bird's song, four notes ringing, can't go wrong

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say

[bridge]
The world spins, time begins, caught within the music's grasp
Lose control, let it roll, feel the pressure as it laps

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say
