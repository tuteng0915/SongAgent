Lyrics :
[verse]
She walks in the room
With a sway in her step
Got a way that she moves
That just takes my breath

[chorus]
She crazy, ooh-ooh
She crazy, ooh-ooh
She crazy, ooh-ooh-oooh
And I can't get enough

[bridge]
In the morning light
She's a beautiful sight
But it's those eyes at night
That hold me tight

[chorus]
She crazy, ooh-ooh
She crazy, ooh-ooh
She crazy, ooh-ooh-oooh
And I can't get enough
