User : 
I'm thinking of a song that's upbeat and kinda quirky. Can you whip up something in the ska style?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create an upbeat and quirky ska-style song for you. To make it more personalized, could you tell me more about what you'd like in the lyrics? Any particular theme or story you want to be told through the song? If not, I'll just go with a fun, nonsensical theme that fits the ska vibe.

 [verse]
Walking down the avenue, my shoes are clicking
Skank to the rhythm, feel the beat quickening

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, let's go berserk
Ska is the sound, making work fun like a perk

[verse]
Sunshine on my shoulders, brass section blazing
In this wild city, everyone's amazing

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, let's go berserk
Ska is the sound, making work fun like a perk

[bridge]
Feel the bassline, it's so sweet
Trumpets blaring, can't be beat
Together we dance on the street
Ska vibes high, impossible to defeat

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, let's go berserk
Ska is the sound, making work fun like a perk
The lyrics are fun, but I was hoping for something that tells a little story. Can we get a narrative in there, maybe about someone finding out their partner is a secret agent?
Agent : 
That sounds like a fun and intriguing twist for your ska song! Let's weave that narrative into the lyrics while keeping the upbeat and quirky style intact. I'll set the new lyrics for you now.

Strolling through the park, life was so serene
Then I saw my lover, exchanging secrets with a man in a trench coat, oh what a scene

Turns out my darling's a spy, life's bittersweet

Messages in bottles, and gadgets in her bag
Every rendezvous, feels like an action-packed saga tag
