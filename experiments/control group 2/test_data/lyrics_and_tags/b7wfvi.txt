Lyrics :
[verse]
In this quiet room, walls whisper my name,
A battle inside, I'm not the same.
Nurse with a smile walks in with two pills,
One's freedom, one's chains, which one will I choose still?

[chorus]
Cool is the choice that I have to make,
Two paths ahead, but it's more than at stake.
I see clarity in her eyes so bright,
But shadows loom long as we pass the night.

[verse 2]
She tells me "Take your time," but I hear the clock tick,
Every moment here feels like I'm on the brink.
Her hand brushes mine, an accidental spark,
In this cold asylum, somehow she leaves a mark.

[chorus]
Cool is the choice that I hold tonight,
Between wrong and right, between dark and light.
Her voice soothes my soul, steady and calm,
Yet every step forward feels like a psalm.

[bridge]
And if I take the pill that sets me free,
Will I lose the part of me that wants to dream?
Or should I swallow fate, let silence unfurl,
The hardest choices come in a tiny pearl.

[final chorus]
Cool is the choice, the story untold,
With trembling fingers, I pick what’s mine to hold.
As the pill dissolves, a tear starts to fall,
Maybe freedom wasn’t the choice after all.
