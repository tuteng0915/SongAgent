Lyrics :
[Verse]
In every step she took, shadows danced along,
Her heart a battlefield, where love and struggle belong.
With painful shoes, she walked through trials untold,
Each step a testament, her courage pure gold.

[Chorus]
Through the echoes of her journey, whispers of wisdom sing,
A tapestry of trials, woven with the thread of spring.
Painful shoes, yet she walked on, with grace she did bring,
In every heartbeat, her resilient spirit would ring.

[Bridge]
Each tear a testament, each scar a story untold,
In the quiet reflection, her strength unfolds bold.
Even with painful shoes, her path she brightly lit,
Love's enduring flame, through every painful bit.
