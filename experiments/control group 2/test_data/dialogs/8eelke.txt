Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. The strum pattern should be simple, and the song should be about a woman. It sounds like it would be performed by a solo artist rather than a band. There's a memorable part where the artist sings "she crazy," followed by a long, distinct falsetto that goes up and down. The style should be reminiscent of 70s-80s acoustic guitar music. Can you help me create something like this?

  ```
  [verse]
  She walks in the room
  With a sway in her step
  Got a way that she moves
  That just takes my breath

  [chorus]
  She crazy, ooh-ooh
  She crazy, ooh-ooh
  She crazy, ooh-ooh-oooh
  And I can't get enough

  [bridge]
  In the morning light
  She's a beautiful sight
  But it's those eyes at night
  That hold me tight

  [chorus]
  She crazy, ooh-ooh
  She crazy, ooh-ooh
  She crazy, ooh-ooh-oooh
  And I can't get enough
  ```
