Hello, song generating agent! I have a very specific song in mind that I'd love for you to create. Here are the details:

I'm looking for a super sad and haunting song with a strong visual component in the lyrics. The imagery should evoke an old barn or house that's falling apart, with a rocking chair, all presented in a black and white, sepia, or faded color palette. Think glitchy, crackly, 16mm or super 8 camera aesthetic.

The song should feature a male and female vocalist singing to each other. The male part should talk about the house, while the female part responds, suggesting there's nothing left for the guy in the house anymore. The theme can be open to interpretation, but it could hint at something tragic like an abortion or a fire.

Musically, it should be really folksy, similar to early Angus & Julia Stone, with a slow and whispery delivery. If possible, try to incorporate the word "Trees" into the title, as it might resonate with the theme or vibe of the song.

Can you generate a song based on these requirements?
