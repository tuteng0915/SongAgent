User : 
I'd love to create a song with that early 2000s folksy acoustic vibe. Can we start with some basic lyrics that capture nostalgia and mention Cuba or Che Guevara?

I've set up some basic lyrics that aim to capture the nostalgic and folksy vibe you're looking for, with mentions of Cuba and Che Guevara. Here's what we have so far:

```
[verse]
In the shade of a worn-out hat
Dreaming 'bout the roads we've sat
Che's shadow on the wall
In Havana's echoing hall

[chorus]
Oh the stories in the air
Of revolution everywhere
With a spirit that won't fade
In the dance of every serenade

[bridge]
From the hills to old cuba's shore
Memories forever soar
Carried on a gentle breeze
Whispered in the mango trees
```
