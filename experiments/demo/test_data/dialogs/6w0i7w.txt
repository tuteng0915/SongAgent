Sure thing! Let's start by specifying the theme and some key elements for the song. I'll go ahead and ask the agent to focus on a pop-punk style with a nostalgic theme about past love.

It seems like we need to provide more details to the agent. Let's tell the agent to add some tags that match the 2000s pop-punk vibe and include the phrase "back back back" in the lyrics.

The agent hasn't generated any lyrics yet. Let's specify that we want the lyrics to include themes of nostalgia and past love, with a catchy part that repeats "back back back."

Let's try again to get those lyrics generated. We need to insist on including the repetitive phrase "back back back" and maintain the theme of longing for a past love.

Let's try a different approach. I'll ask for a fast-paced rhythm with rapid drumming, and make sure the agent knows we're aiming for that 2000s pop-punk or emo vibe.

Alright, let's keep it simple this time. Just request a song with high energy, pop-punk style, and lyrics about past love. We'll worry about the "back back back" part later.

Okay, I've halted the process so we can start fresh. Let's try one more time to get this song generated with all the elements you're looking for. I'll keep it straightforward and ensure the agent understands the vibe you want.
