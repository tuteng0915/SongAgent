Lyrics :
[verse]
freeeee, whoa oh

[chorus]
gets the best of me at nighttt

[verse]
Underneath the starlit sky,
Dreams are weaving through my mind.
Stories told in whispers soft,
In the quiet, love we find.

[chorus]
Gets the best of me at night,
When silence wraps around so tight.
Thoughts of you, they dance and play,
In the moonlight's gentle sway.
