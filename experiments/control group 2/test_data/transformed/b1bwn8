Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I want to generate a somber and soulful song with deep, dark undertones, sung by a female vocalist. The lyrics should evoke imagery related to falling into a river or being submerged in water, with an emotional intensity that matches the visuals of someone creating velvet art while listening. It should have a slow tempo and feature rich instrumentation—think haunting melodies, maybe some piano or strings—to give it weight and depth. Additionally, this song could fit alongside tracks like "Fly Like a Bird," so consider incorporating elements of alternative rock or soft ballads from the late '90s or early 2000s. Can you create something based on these details?
