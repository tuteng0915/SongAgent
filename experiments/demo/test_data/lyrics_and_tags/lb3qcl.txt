Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
Walking paths once traveled, shadows linger still,
Echoes of laughter, moments we can't refill.
Seasons pass, they pull us in their turning tide,
Leaving us with lessons, some we chose to hide.

[Chorus]
Change is the only constant, time moves on,
Memories like footprints in the sands of dawn.
Through every high and every low we've grown,
Embrace the unknown, find a place to call our own.

[Verse 2]
Pages worn by whispers of who we used to be,
In quiet corners, secrets softly plea.
Each chapter tells a story, written in the stars,
The beauty of our battles leaves its scars.

[Bridge]
Hold close the moments, let them fade away,
In their place, new dreams begin to play.
Every ending births a start anew,
Carry forth the past as future comes into view.

[Chorus]
Change is the only constant, time moves on,
Memories like footprints in the sands of dawn.
Through every high and every low we've grown,
Embrace the unknown, find a place to call our own.
