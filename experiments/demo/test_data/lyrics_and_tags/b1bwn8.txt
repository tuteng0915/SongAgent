Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of yesterday, I find my way,
A shadow cast by the pale moonlight.
Every step whispers your name,
In this endless night, where silence reigns.

[chorus]
Longing fills the spaces you left behind,
A bitter sweetness in every tear I find.
Despair grips tight, yet love holds on,
In memories painted by dawn's early song.

[verse]
Through desolate streets where we once danced,
The ghost of laughter lingers still.
Each corner turned, a hope misplaced,
Yet in my heart, our moments linger, unerased.

[bridge]
Time moves slow, seasons change,
But here inside, it always stays the same.
Dreams of you, a haunting refrain,
In the quiet hours, they softly remain.

[chorus]
Longing fills the spaces you left behind,
A bitter sweetness in every tear I find.
Despair grips tight, yet love holds on,
In memories painted by dawn's early song.
