Lyrics :
[verse]
I've walked through the heart of America,
Where dreams are born and hope is near.
Every corner holds a story,
Of those who've loved and held so dear.

[chorus]
In this land called America,
Underneath its vast sky.
We find our place in a foreign land,
Where we dare to live and try.

[verse]
From sea to shining sea we roam,
Searching for where we belong.
In every city, every small town,
We sing our song as we move along.

[chorus]
In this land called America,
Beneath the stars that brightly gleam.
Finding home in a foreign land,
Chasing dreams on the golden stream.

[bridge]
Oh, how sweet the promise of tomorrow,
In this land of endless opportunity.
With courage, we stand, hand in hand,
Together shaping what's yet to be.
