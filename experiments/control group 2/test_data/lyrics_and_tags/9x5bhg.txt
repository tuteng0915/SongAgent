Lyrics :
[verse]
Cruising along the winding roads of Mulholland
Feeling the rhythm in every curve we unfold
In and out, like a dance with the horizon
This drive's poetry, let it be foretold

[chorus]
We ride to the beat of an endless motion
Through night’s embrace and day's devotion
On this ribbon of asphalt where shadows play
Our journey's just begun upon this techno sway

[verse]
Echoes of engines sing our serenade
Underneath the stars that never fade
Each turn a stanza, each straight a line
Together we write what the night will find

[chorus]
We ride to the beat of an endless motion
Through night’s embrace and day's devotion
On this ribbon of asphalt where dreams ignite
Bound by the road under electric light

[bridge]
Half-sung whispers float on the breeze
Half-spoken truths carried through trees
The pulse of wheels on tarmac trails
An electro pulse as freedom prevails
