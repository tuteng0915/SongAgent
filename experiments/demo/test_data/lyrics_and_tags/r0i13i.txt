Lyrics :
[verse]
Under the neon lights, we dance tonight
Feel the rhythm, let it take you high
Step by step, moving with the groove
Every heartbeat's got a story to prove

[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the power, it's all on you
Shine so bright, like a disco ball
In this moment, you can have it all

[verse]
The night is young, and we're just getting started
With every spin, our dreams are ignited
Hands in the air, feel the freedom call
Together we rise, never gonna fall

[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the power, it's all on you
Shine so bright, like a disco ball
In this moment, you can have it all

[bridge]
Saxophone solo wailing through the night
Funky guitar riffs setting hearts alight
Synthesizers spinning tales untold
In this magical world where dreams unfold

[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the power, it's all on you
Shine so bright, like a disco ball
In this moment, you can have it all
