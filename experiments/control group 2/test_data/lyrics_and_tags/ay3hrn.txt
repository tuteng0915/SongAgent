Lyrics :
[verse]
Shadows fall where whispers play,
In the moonlight's gentle sway.
With every step, a secret unfolds,
A tale of mystery that never grows old.

[chorus]
Cooling, cruising, dance, cooling da-a-a-ance,
Underneath the stars, we take this chance.
Cooling, cruising, feel the night enhance,
Our spirits lifting in a cooling da-a-a-ance.

[verse]
Velvet skies embrace the night,
Hidden truths come into sight.
With every beat, our hearts align,
In this moment, everything is fine.

[bridge]
Echoes linger, shadows spin,
I said it, I said it agaaaaaiiin.
Lost within the haze of sound,
In this dance, no bounds are found.

[chorus]
Cooling, cruising, dance, cooling da-a-a-ance,
Underneath the stars, we take this chance.
Cooling, cruising, feel the night enhance,
Our spirits lifting in a cooling da-a-a-ance.
