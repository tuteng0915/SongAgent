Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe and theme. Here’s what I’m thinking:

I want the song to capture that chaotic, mischievous energy of someone unintentionally causing mayhem as they go about their day in a carefree way—like bumping into things and tossing objects aside without realizing the chain reactions they’re setting off behind them. The tone should be colorful, fun, and a little wild, matching the kind of quirky humor you'd see in an over-the-top music video.

For style, let’s aim for something inspired by pop punk or California punk bands—high-energy, catchy, with just enough edge to keep it cool but not too serious. Think upbeat rhythms, maybe some crunchy guitar riffs, and lyrics that tell this story of accidental chaos with a playful twist.

Can you help me generate a song like that?
