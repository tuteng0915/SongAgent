[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I remember your smile,
A fleeting moment, yet it lingers for a while.

[chorus]
Longing for the days we had, love once so bright,
Now just shadows in the fading light.

[verse]
Walking down these empty streets, where we used to roam,
Every corner holds a memory, every stone feels like home.

[bridge]
Though time has passed, and we've grown apart,
The echoes of our love still gently tug at my heart.

[chorus]
Longing for the days we had, love once so bright,
Now just shadows in the fading light.

[outro]
Acceptance in the silence, where whispers used to be,
Nostalgia's sweet embrace, where love remains free.
