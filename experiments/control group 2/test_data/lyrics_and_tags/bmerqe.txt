Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet room, an old man lies,
Memories flicker in his weary eyes.
A sudden burst, the door flies wide,
A woman enters with a song to bide.

[chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The hills we danced on, the love that was all.
With every note, the past unfolds,
A tale of joy, a tale untold.

[verse]
Flashbacks swirl, like leaves in flight,
Dancing on the hill under moonlit light.
Yet here he sits, in his chair so still,
As she sings her song, defying time's will.

[bridge]
Marching band joins in the refrain,
Echoes of laughter, echoes of pain.
Life's final chapter, yet music remains,
Binding us close through life's changing lanes.

[chorus]
Do you remember, do you recall?
The hills we danced on, the love that was all.
With every beat, our hearts align,
In this timeless melody divine.
