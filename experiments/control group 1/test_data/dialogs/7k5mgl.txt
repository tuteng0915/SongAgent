Sure thing! Since you're looking for something upbeat and lively, how about we go with a pop genre? Pop music often has energetic beats and catchy melodies that could match the vibe you're aiming for. If you have any specific themes or additional preferences for the song, feel free to share them now! Otherwise, I'll start crafting some lyrics and tags based on this direction.
