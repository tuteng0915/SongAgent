I'm looking for a Nu-Metal song that tells the story of someone heading off to war, maybe Iraq, with moody visuals and intense emotions. Can you work with that?

Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about the specific emotions and visuals you'd like to be expressed in the song? For example, are there particular scenes or feelings you want to highlight?
User : 
The emotions should be intense, with a focus on the internal conflict and fear of the person going to war. Visuals could include dark, stormy skies and soldiers preparing for battle.

[Verse]
Dark clouds gather in the sky
A heart torn, a silent goodbye
Boots echo on the cold hard ground
Fear and doubt start to surround

[Chorus]
Marching towards the unknown fight
Praying for the morning light
In the shadow of the stormy night
Hoping to be wrong about the fight

[Bridge]
Steel and fire in their eyes
Preparation under darkened skies
The clash of war, the battle cry
A soldier's heart, asking why
