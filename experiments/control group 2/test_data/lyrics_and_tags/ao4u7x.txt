Lyrics :
[verse]
Beneath the surface where shadows play,
In the deep blue river that pulls me away.
I hear the echoes, a family's call,
Chains in rhythm, they bind us all.

[chorus]
We're diving deeper, where dreams are made,
In this watery world, we're unafraid.
With every heartbeat, like waves we sway,
In this family of rivers, we find our way.

[verse]
A thousand whispers beneath the tide,
The gospel truth flows, impossible to hide.
Soulful voices rise, like a choir in flight,
In the depths of night, we hold on tight.

[bridge]
Oh, the chains rattle and the spirit sings,
In this underground haven, where hope springs.
Together we journey, together we stand,
Hand in hand, across this promised land.

[chorus]
We're diving deeper, where dreams are made,
In this watery world, we're unafraid.
With every heartbeat, like waves we sway,
In this family of rivers, we find our way.

[outro]
So let the current take us where it may,
Through winding waters, come what may.
For in this family, there's no dismay,
Only love that guides us through each new day.
