Lyrics :
[Verse]
She walks in the room, lights up the place (Trumpet x4)
Everybody turns, she's got that grace (Trumpet x4)

[Chorus]
Oh, she's the one, shining so bright
In this world of darkness, she's our light

[Bridge]
With every step she takes, hearts mend (Trumpet x4)
Her smile could change the world, my friend (Trumpet x4, different)
