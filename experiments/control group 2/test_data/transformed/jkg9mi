Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on some specific details. The song should capture the style of something that could have been popular in the early 2010s, performed by a female singer with a band. The vibe should be wistful and melancholy, but still maintain a moderate tempo—so not too slow or sad, but also not upbeat or overly optimistic. Picture a music video with the singer and her bandmates performing against a plain white background.

One key lyric that should be included is: [insert main lyric here].

Can you create something with those elements?
