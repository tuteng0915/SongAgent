Lyrics :
[verse]
Spinnin' dials in the moonlight glow
Suds and bubbles, watch 'em overflow
Got my rhythm with the washing machines
In this laundromat, we're livin' our dreams

[chorus]
We'll dance through the rinse cycle
Spin around like a disco ball
Fold it up, we're feeling vital
Laundry never felt so raw

[verse]
Jeans in the dryer, they're getting hot
Tumble twist and give them a lot
White shirts glowing under neon light
This is our time to get it all night

[chorus]
We'll dance through the rinse cycle
Spin around like a disco ball
Fold it up, we're feeling vital
Laundry never felt so raw

[bridge]
Take your socks off, let's get loose
Wash away the day, there's no excuse
Detergent magic, bleach and sass
Cleaning clothes with a little class

[chorus]
We'll dance through the rinse cycle
Spin around like a disco ball
Fold it up, we're feeling vital
Laundry never felt so raw
