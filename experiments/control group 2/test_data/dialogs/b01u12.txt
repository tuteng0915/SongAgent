Hello, song generating agent! I need your help to create a song that matches the following description:  

It should be an upbeat pop/synth pop track with a lively and steady drumbeat that keeps the energy high throughout. In the chorus, there should be quick ascending piano chords that give it a dynamic and uplifting feel. The overall vibe should evoke a sleek, neon-lit nighttime atmosphere—something that feels modern yet retro, like a dazzling cityscape under electric lights. The singer should be male, with a smooth and charismatic vocal style reminiscent of Robert Palmer.  

Can you generate a song like this for me? Let’s call it "Neon Pulse."

I have generated the song "Neon Pulse" based on your description. It's an upbeat pop/synth pop track with lively and steady drumbeats, dynamic and uplifting piano chords in the chorus, and a sleek, neon-lit nighttime atmosphere. The male singer has a smooth and charismatic vocal style reminiscent of Robert Palmer.

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Walking through the city lights,
Neon shining in my eyes,
Every corner calls my name,
In this rhythm, I'm not the same.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.

[verse]
Shadows move with every sound,
The city's heartbeat all around,
Feel the rush, it's taking me,
To a world where dreams are free.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.

[bridge]
Underneath the starlit glow,
Where the night and secrets flow,
Time stands still, we lose control,
In this dance, we find our soul.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.
