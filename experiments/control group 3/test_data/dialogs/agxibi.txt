Sure thing! Let's get started on that hype rap song. First off, how long would you like the song to be? Just give me a rough idea in terms of minutes or a typical number of verses for a rap song.
Agent : 
Great! A typical rap song usually has about 3 to 4 verses, a chorus that repeats a couple of times, and maybe a bridge section. In terms of length, this usually translates to around 3 to 4 minutes. Does that sound good to you, or would you prefer a different length for your hype rap song? Also, do you have any specific themes or messages you want to convey in the lyrics?
User : 
The length and structure you suggested sound perfect. As for themes or messages, I think it should be all about empowerment and having a good time. You know, something that makes the listener feel unstoppable. Can we go with that?

Absolutely! We'll focus on empowerment and having a good time, making the listener feel unstoppable. Before we proceed with generating the lyrics and tags, I want to make sure I have a full understanding of your preferences. Could you please share what kind of vibe or energy level you're aiming for? For example, do you prefer a more aggressive, in-your-face style, or something smoother but still high-energy?
