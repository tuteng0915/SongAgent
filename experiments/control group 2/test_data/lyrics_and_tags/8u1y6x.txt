Lyrics :
[verse]
Waving through the window,
In a world that doesn't know,
I'm reaching out to find you,
Any way the wind blows.

[chorus]
Oh, I hear you whispering,
Words I long to understand,
Listen through the silence,
With the touch of your hand.

[verse]
Every sound is a message,
Every breeze has something to say,
I'm here waiting patiently,
For you to come my way.

[chorus]
Oh, I hear you whispering,
Words I long to understand,
Listen through the silence,
With the touch of your hand.

[bridge]
The window's just a pane of glass,
But it's where I see my dreams,
And if you wave back someday,
We'll shatter every seam.
