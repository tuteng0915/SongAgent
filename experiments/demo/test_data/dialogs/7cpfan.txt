I’d like you to generate a song that fits this description: it should have a 70s-80s rock vibe, featuring an instrument that sounds like a fairground organ or accordion. The tone of the song should be neutral—not too sad, but not overly happy either. It should feel repetitive and hypnotic in its structure. The singer should be male, with a youthful voice, sounding like he’s in his 20s or early 30s. Let’s create something unique based on these features!

```
[verse]
Driving down the endless road
Open skies above, feel so bold
Wheels keep turning, time unfolds
Chasing horizons, never growing old

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold

[verse]
The fairground lights flash by in the night
Accordion plays as we take flight
Hypnotic rhythms guide our way
Through the dawn of each brand new day

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold

[bridge]
In the rearview mirror, shadows fade
Forward is the only path we've made
Repetitive beats like a heartbeat's drum
Underneath the sun, where we all come from

[chorus]
Freedom's call, a wandering soul
Underneath the open skies, we're whole
With every mile, a story told
On this endless road, we find our gold
```
