Hey, song agent! I need your help generating a song that fits these requirements:  

It should have a romantic feel, perfect for weddings, with smooth and buttery guitar riffs reminiscent of "Something" by The Beatles. The singer should be a male rock vocalist with a soothing tone. Think heartfelt lyrics, a slow to mid-tempo rhythm, and an overall warm, dreamy vibe. Can you create something like that for me?
