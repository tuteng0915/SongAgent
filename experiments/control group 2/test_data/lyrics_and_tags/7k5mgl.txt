Lyrics :
[verse]
I met this girl the other day
She smiled at me, I thought she'd stay
But then she said, with a gentle tone
Let's just be friends, let's just be friends

[chorus]
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends
Every time I try, every time I try
It's like a never-ending cycle in my life
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends

[verse]
I bought her flowers, wrote her songs
Thought we were two, but she was gone
Another one bites the dust
Let's just be friends, let's just be friends

[chorus]
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends
Every time I try, every time I try
It's like a never-ending cycle in my life
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends

[bridge]
Why can't I find the right one?
Is it me, or is it something else?
I keep on trying, but it's no use
Let's just be friends, let's just be friends

[chorus]
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends
Every time I try, every time I try
It's like a never-ending cycle in my life
She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends
