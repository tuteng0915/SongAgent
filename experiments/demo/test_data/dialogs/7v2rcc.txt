Sure thing! Let's start by nailing down the tempo and style. I'll aim for a high-energy pop-punk vibe reminiscent of The Ataris. How does that sound?

That sounds great! Before we proceed, I need to gather a bit more information to ensure the song aligns perfectly with your vision. Could you please specify:

1. The desired tempo (beats per minute) for the high-energy pop-punk vibe?
2. Any specific themes or topics you'd like the lyrics to cover? 

Feel free to share any additional preferences as well!
User : 
Let's keep the tempo upbeat, maybe around 150 BPM. For themes, how about something that captures the angst and excitement of youth?

Great! We've set the tempo to an upbeat 150 BPM and will capture the angst and excitement of youth in the lyrics. Now, let's draft some lyrics that embody these themes.

Here's a preliminary structure for our song:

[Verse]
In the haze of neon lights, chasing shadows in the night
We're the rebels, we're the fights, bound by dreams but not by sight

[Chorus]
Oh, we'll scream out loud, voices echoing through the crowd
Caught between the should and proud, riding waves of highs and doubts

[Bridge]
Every heartbeat pounds defiance, in this chaotic dance of life
Eyes wide open, fueled by fire, burning through another Friday night

It seems like we need to refine the lyrics a bit more. How about we incorporate the "everything will be alright alright" chorus you mentioned earlier? And maybe start with "go and leave me" for the intro?

Go and leave me, in the silence of your wake

Oh, we'll scream out loud, voices echoing through the crowd
Everything will be alright, alright, riding waves of highs and doubts
