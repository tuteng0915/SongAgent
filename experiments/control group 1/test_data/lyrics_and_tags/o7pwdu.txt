Lyrics :
[verse]
Waking up late again, sun shines through the mess
Got a head full of big dreams but my room's a confessional
Pizza boxes, comic books, living life like a test
But in my mind, I'm the king, wearing an invisible crest

[chorus]
Slacker superhero, saving days in my mind
Leaping tall obligations, but my cape's hard to find
In this world made of deadlines, I'm a rebel with a pause
Every zero's a hero when they're breaking all the laws

[verse]
TV glow lights my face as adventures unfold
In every episode, it's my courage that's told
Reality calls but I dodge with a lazy salute
I'll conquer the world, just as soon as I get to it

[bridge]
Is it so wrong to dream in between the snooze alarms?
A knight in shining armor, even if I'm dressed in charms

[chorus]
Slacker superhero, saving days in my mind
Leaping tall obligations, but my cape's hard to find
In this world made of deadlines, I'm a rebel with a pause
Every zero's a hero when they're breaking all the laws
