Sure, let's start with the sound of the song. I need to know if you want any specific instruments or sounds to be prominent in the track.
Agent : 
To better tailor the song to your preferences, could you please specify if there are any particular instruments or sounds you'd like to be featured prominently? For example, do you prefer a guitar-driven melody, a piano-based tune, or perhaps something with a strong electronic beat? If you're not sure, I can suggest some options based on popular choices.
User : 
Let's go with a strong electronic beat, something that feels modern yet has a classic touch.

Great! I've set the tags for your song to include an electronic, modern, and classic feel with a strong beat. Now, let's move on to the lyrics. Could you provide me with some themes or specific lines you'd like included in the song? If not, I can generate something based on common themes. Once we have the lyrics, you'll need to press the "generate" button to create the song.

I'd like the lyrics to include a phrase similar to "do do do dodo something for Michael," with "Michael" being a placeholder for a man's name. The "do" parts are placeholders for forgotten words, and it would be nice if the word "for" is included, though I'm not certain about that.

I've crafted some lyrics that incorporate a phrase similar to "do do do dodo something for Michael," with "Michael" serving as a placeholder for a man's name. Hereâ€™s what the lyrics look like:

```
[verse]
In the night, we sing a song,
do do do dodo something for Michael,
Underneath the starlit sky,
With every beat, our hearts align.

[chorus]
Oh, oh, dancing through the silence,
Feel the rhythm, let it guide us,
do do do dodo something for Michael,
Together we'll find the way.

[bridge]
Every step, every breath,
Leads us closer to the truth,
In this moment, we're alive,
do do do dodo something new.
```
