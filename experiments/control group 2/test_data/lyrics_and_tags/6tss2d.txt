Lyrics :
[intro]
*imitating phone ringing*
"I know she's home."

[verse 1]
Hello? Is this real?
I heard your voice, it hit like a steal
You said you're done, our time's expired
But I was blind, thought love was fire

[chorus]
The line went dead, but the words still sting
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud
Of promises broken, they never last long

[verse 2]
Pick up the pieces, try to move on
But every ringtone takes me back home
To that moment when honesty cut
Like a knife through the fabric of us

[chorus]
The line went dead, but the words still sting
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud
Of promises broken, they never last long

[bridge]
And if I could rewind, erase that sound
Would I change your mind or just fall down?
Phone calls end, but scars remain deep
In the story of us, there's no receipt

[chorus]
The line went dead, but the words still sting
She said goodbye, and my heart won't sing
Now I'm stuck here with the echoes loud
Of promises broken, they never last long

[outro]
Click... silence.
