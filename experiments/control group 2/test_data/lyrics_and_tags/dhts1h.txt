Lyrics :
[verse]
Upon the river black as night,
Children cloaked in pale moonlight.
A boat that drifts, no oar in sight,
To realms unseen, beyond the fright.

[chorus]
Oh, carry me to lands afar,
Where dead trees stand like notes of tar.
Beneath the moon's watchful eye,
We sail away, with nary a sigh.

[verse]
Through halls once grand, now left to rot,
Where laughter danced and love was caught.
Now beasts do roam where guests once sought,
Their growls echo thoughts distraught.

[chorus]
Oh, carry me to lands afar,
Where dead trees stand like notes of tar.
Beneath the moon's watchful eye,
We sail away, with nary a sigh.

[bridge]
Her face adorned, a ghastly grin,
The mistress calls from deep within.
With painted skull and eyes so thin,
She beckons forth, let sins begin.

[chorus]
Oh, carry me to lands afar,
Where dead trees stand like notes of tar.
Beneath the moon's watchful eye,
We sail away, with nary a sigh.

[outro]
And as we fade into the haze,
The river hums its mournful phrase.
Forever lost, but unafraid,
The night consumes, our souls displayed.
