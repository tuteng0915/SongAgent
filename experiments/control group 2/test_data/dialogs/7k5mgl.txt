Hey song agent! I need your help to generate a song based on these features. It should be an upbeat, catchy, and fun track, possibly with one or two singers. The singer could be a black guy, and while it might not be a rap song, it should have a lively vibe. The song's theme could revolve around a guy having bad luck with the ladies. There's a repeated line in the lyrics that goes something like, "She said let's just be friends, she said let's just be friends." Can you create a song with these elements?
