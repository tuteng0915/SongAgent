Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the storm, I stand my ground,
Facing the shadows, no fear in sight.
[chorus]
Rising above, breaking through the pain,
With every challenge, my spirit ignites.
[bridge]
Feel the power surge, as the strings unfold,
The melody of triumph, a tale untold.
[verse]
Through the fire and rain, I forge ahead,
With every step, my path is led.
