Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadow of the neon night
Where the echoes of time take flight
A silhouette against the moon's embrace
Whispers drift through the empty space

[chorus]
I can feeeel you, in the static air
A haunting sound that's always there
With every beat, my heart defies
The silence that beneath us lies

[verse]
Neon lights fade to grey
As we dance with the ghosts of yesterday
In a world where shadows play
And love is but a fallen star's ray

[chorus]
I can feeeel you, like a distant drum
Calling out, where the lost souls come
Through the haze of a fading dream
Your memory sets my heart agleam

[bridge]
The pulse of the city, an electric tide
In the veins of the night, where secrets hide
We’re chasing echoes, in a sonic race
Leaving trails in the fabric of space

[chorus]
I can feeeel you, in the thunder’s roar
In the pulse of life, forevermore
Our spirits entwined, in this timeless song
Together we’ll journey, where none belong
