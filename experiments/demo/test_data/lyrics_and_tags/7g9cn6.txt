Lyrics :
[spoken-word intro]
You had one job!
I gave you everything...

[verse 1]
Walking down these streets alone,
Thought you were my friend, but I've grown.
All the trust I've thrown your way,
Now it's gone, and I'm astray.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
But from the ashes, I will rise.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Yet in this storm, I find my heart.

[verse 2]
Every word you said was a lie,
Underneath the stars, I wonder why.
Together we laughed, together we cried,
But now I see through your disguise.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
But from the ashes, I will rise.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Yet in this storm, I find my heart.

[bridge]
Maybe someday I'll find peace again,
Until then, let this wound mend.
For now, I'll carry this scar,
A reminder of just who you are.

[chorus]
The pain of betrayal cuts deep inside,
But from the ashes, I will rise.
Once we stood, now we fall apart,
Yet in this storm, I find my heart.
