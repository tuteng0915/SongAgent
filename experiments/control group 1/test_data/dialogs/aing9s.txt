User : 
I'm excited to help you create your song! Let's start by focusing on the opening guitar melody with a Russian or Mexican vibe. Do you have a preference for which one, or should we blend both styles?
Agent : 
To create the perfect opening guitar melody, I'll first need to understand your preference better. Let's use the 'preference' tool to find out whether you lean more towards a Russian or Mexican vibe, or if you'd like to blend both styles.

I'll call the preference tool now.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems we need to set your preferences first. Since you're excited about a Russian or Mexican vibe for the guitar melody, let's decide on that.

Would you prefer:
1. A Russian-themed melody,
2. A Mexican-themed melody, or
3. A blend of both styles?

Please provide your choice so we can proceed with the song generation.

It looks like we're having trouble getting your preferences through the tool. Since we can't determine your choice automatically, could you please manually specify whether you'd like a Russian-themed melody, a Mexican-themed melody, or a blend of both for the opening guitar part?

Once I have this information, I will be able to proceed with generating the song.

Since we're unable to use the preference tool at the moment, let's decide on the style manually. For the opening guitar melody, please indicate your choice:

1. A melody with a Russian vibe,
2. A melody with a Mexican vibe, or
3. A combination of both Russian and Mexican styles?

Once you've made your selection, I'll be able to move forward with creating your song.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems there's an ongoing issue with receiving your preferences through the tool. To move forward, I'll make an assumption based on your initial excitement for a Russian or Mexican vibe.

If I have to choose, I will create a blend of both Russian and Mexican styles, which could result in a unique and exciting melody. If this isn't what you had in mind, please let me know your specific preference.

Assuming you're okay with blending both styles, I'll set the tags for the song accordingly. Let's proceed with that.


Successfully set the parameter tags
The tags for your song have been set to include a blend of Russian and Mexican vibes with an emphasis on guitar melody. 

Now, let's create the lyrics starting with the opening section that will feature this exciting blend of styles. After we have the initial lyrics, you can press the "generate" button to create the melody.

I'll draft the opening lyrics now.


Successfully set the parameter lyrics
The opening lyrics for your song have been set, capturing the essence of a blended Russian and Mexican vibe. Here's what we have:

[Opening]
Guitar sings with a tale to tell,
Russian frost meets Mexican shell.
Strings of fire, passion's call,
East meets West, we'll have it all.

With the tags and lyrics in place, you can now press the "generate" button to create the melody for your unique guitar opening. Once you've done that, we can proceed with the next steps if needed. How does that sound?
