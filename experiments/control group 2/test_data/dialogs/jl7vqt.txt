Alright, let me transform this into a generation request for the song agent:

Hey there, song agent! I need your help to *generate* an upbeat, fast-paced indie rock song that’s super cheerful and reminiscent of Weezer’s "Surf Wax America." Here are the details:  

- The song should have a 3-chord electric guitar sequence running through most of it.  
- After each chorus, include a short drum solo accompanied by male voices shouting “EY-EY-EY-EY.”  
- Sprinkle in some surf-style flute solos throughout the track—it gives it that quirky, beachy vibe.  

If you can whip up something like this, I’ll be eternally grateful (and owe you a virtual pop). Let’s make some magic happen!
