Hey there, song agent! I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of TLC or Salt n' Pepa's style. The lyrics should tell a story about a guy who's a real player, smooth-talking his way through life. However, the twist is that his reckless lifestyle catches up with him, leading to a tragic end due to something like AIDS. Itâ€™s meant to be a cautionary tale wrapped in a catchy, 90s hip-hop vibe. Can you help me create something with this concept?

I've set up the tags and lyrics for a song that tells the story you envisioned, capturing the 90s hip-hop vibe of TLC or Salt n' Pepa with a cautionary tale at its heart. The lyrics portray the rise and fall of a smooth-talking player whose lifestyle ultimately leads to tragedy.

Here are the sections of the lyrics I've prepared:

```
[verse]
There once was a player in the game of life,
Smooth talk on his lips, living with no strife.
Ladies loved him, his charm was gold,
But his secrets were many, his heart was cold.

[chorus]
Playaz ballin', living tall with no falls,
Till the rhythm of truth catches y'all.
The choices you make can lead to dismay,
A lesson learned too late along the way.

[verse]
He danced through danger, never heeded the signs,
Infectious whispers where true love declines.
Love turned lethal, pleasure turned pain,
The reaper's knocking, can't play no more games.

[bridge]
Life ain't a game when it slips through your hands,
Regret's heavy burden, death's reprimands.
AIDS took its toll, now he pays the price,
No rewind button, not rolling the dice.

[chorus]
Playaz ballin', living tall with no falls,
Till the rhythm of truth catches y'all.
The choices you make can lead to dismay,
A story retold in sorrowful relay.
```
