Lyrics :
[verse]
Racing through the neon glow,
City lights, where we lose control.
Heartbeats sync with every step,
In this moment, we forget.

[chorus]
Break it down now (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
Dancing under moonlit skies,
Feel alive in the rhythm of the night (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)

[verse]
Shadows dance as stars align,
Freedom calls in the midnight shine.

[bridge]
duttily duttly dah, let the music take you there,
duttily duttly dah, nothing else compares.

[chorus]
Break it down now (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
Dancing under moonlit skies,
Feel alive in the rhythm of the night (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
