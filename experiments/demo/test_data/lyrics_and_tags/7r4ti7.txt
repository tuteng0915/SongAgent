Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
Upon the rooftop, stars above concealed,
A silhouette of sorrow, on the edge revealed.
Her tears like raindrops, falling through the night,
He reached for her with trembling hands, a beacon burning bright.

[Chorus]
Caught in a spiral, love turns to dust,
In shadows we trusted, now break and bust.
From the highest heavens to the depths we fall,
Bound by the cycle, we're prisoners of it all.

[Verse 2]
Love bloomed like roses, amidst the city's grime,
But beneath her touch, hid thorns that cut like time.
With every whispered promise, came control and disdain,
The sweetness turned to poison, driving him insane.

[Bridge]
Now he sees the cracks within her painted smile,
The echoes of her laughter, they mock him all the while.
She’s back upon the rooftop, where it all began,
The cycle starts anew, a haunting déjà vu.

[Chorus]
Caught in a spiral, love turns to dust,
In shadows we trusted, now break and bust.
From the highest heavens to the depths we fall,
Bound by the cycle, we're prisoners of it all.

[Outro]
Upon the rooftop, stars above concealed,
The ghost of love has lingered, but its fate is now sealed.
And as she steps closer, to the edge once more,
The cycle spins, a tale of love we can't ignore.
