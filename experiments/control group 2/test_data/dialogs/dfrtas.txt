Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits the following description: It’s a rock song with a male vocalist, themed perfectly for Halloween. The structure of the lyrics should go through every letter of the alphabet, describing how different people meet their demise in a darkly humorous way (e.g., "J is for Janice who died in a well"). Additionally, the song should open with a sample inspired by *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. Let’s create something eerie, creative, and fun for my Halloween playlist!

I have generated a rock song tailored for Halloween with your requested features. The lyrics follow an alphabetical theme where each letter corresponds to how different individuals meet their demise in a darkly humorous way. The song also opens with a *Nightmare Before Christmas*-inspired chanting intro.

Here's a quick preview of the structure:

- **[Intro]**: A *Nightmare Before Christmas*-style chant sets the eerie tone.
- **[Verse 1]**: "A is for Alice, who fell down a hole..."
- **[Chorus]**: "From A to Z, they all met their end..."
- **[Bridge]**: Ooooh, it’s creepy, it’s kooky...
- **[Outro]**: "Z is for Zachary, zapped by a wire..."
