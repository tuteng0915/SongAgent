Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of a late 90s, radio-friendly, alternative rock track. The song should revolve around the theme of a slacker-type character who sees himself as the hero of his own world. It should have a cheesy, yet catchy vibe that could potentially annoy someone with its repetitive nature. The sound should be typical of 90s alternative music, with a male singer, and feel like it could have been a one-hit wonder played on MTV. Let's create this nostalgic tune!
