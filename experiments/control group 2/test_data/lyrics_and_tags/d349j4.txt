Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows I walk alone,
Feeling lost, I've nowhere to go.
My heart's a whisper against the wind,
So how much longer can I take?

[chorus]
Break these chains that bind my soul,
Let the fire within me explode.
From the ashes, I'll rise again,
Stronger than I've ever been.

[bridge]
The storm is coming, I hear it call,
A surge of power, I'll give it my all.
Feel the rush, it's time to break free,
This is who I'm meant to be.

[chorus]
Break these chains that bind my soul,
Let the fire within me explode.
From the ashes, I'll rise again,
Stronger than I've ever been.
