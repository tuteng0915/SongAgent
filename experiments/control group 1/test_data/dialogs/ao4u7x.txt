User : 
I'd like a song that feels like the 2010s alternative scene, with a unique percussion sound and a soulful female vocalist. Can you start working on that?

Sure, I can help with that. Since you haven't provided your preferences yet, I'll go ahead and generate a song based on your description of the 2010s alternative scene, unique percussion sound, and a soulful female vocalist.

I'll set the tags and lyrics now.
