I want a song that's fast-paced and full of energy, something that would fit right into an action-packed 90s or 2000s flick. Think Beastie Boys meets funky basslines with a British or twangy American vocal style. Can you whip that up for me?

The lyrics should be all about movement and energy, like parkour or action scenes. And I think I'd prefer the British accent for the vocals. Let's go with that.

I've crafted some lyrics that embody the themes of movement and energy, perfect for action scenes or parkour. The British vocal style you prefer is also integrated into the song's concept. Here's a preview:

[Verse]
Racing through the city streets, shadows leap and bound,
Parkour in the moonlight, feet don't touch the ground.
Buildings turn to playgrounds, every wall a friend,
In this urban jungle, the chase will never end.

[Chorus]
Move it like a movie scene, action-packed and wild,
Feel the rush of freedom, dance to chaos styled.
Jumping, flipping, defying gravity's decree,
British beats with funky bass, set your spirit free.

[Bridge]
Heart is pounding faster, adrenaline's embrace,
Every twist and turn reveals another race.
With a voice that's got that accent, London's on my mind,
Energy unbridled, let our spirits intertwine.

Now that we have both the tags and lyrics set, you can press the "generate" button to create the song.
