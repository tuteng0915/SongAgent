Lyrics :
[Verse]
Feeling so numb, like I'm frozen in time,
Every breath is a battle, every move is a climb.

[Chorus]
I'm lost in the silence, can't find my way out,
The world keeps spinning but I'm standing in doubt.

[Bridge]
Shadows whisper, they pull me under,
In this cold place, I keep on wondering.
