Lyrics :
[verse]
You plaster on that smirk again
A wolf in sheep's clothing, the same old sin
I see right through your charade
The masquerade of promises unpaid

[chorus]
Do you even hear yourself?
'Cause that’s not who you are
You sell the dream but it’s all a scheme
Faking every single scar

[verse]
You change your face with every scene
Same empty words, recycled mean
This broken record skips and screeches
Another act, but never reaches

[chorus]
No, you don't feel a thing you sing
Your borrowed truths don’t mean a ring
The veil is lifting, now we see
The hollow shell you're destined to be

[bridge]
The silence roars when voices fade
We're trapped within this serenade
Let the silence grow, let it scream
What once was fire has turned to steam

[chorus]
And still, you don't hear it, can't repair it
The mirror shatters from the weight of it
On jagged edges, we bleed and break
Finding truth in every raw mistake

[ending]
And I don’t know what it’s like to be you either
But at least I own the pain I deliver
