Lyrics :
[verse]
Finally see the light
In this world of darkness
I've been searching for a reason
To find my way back home

[chorus]
Ba ba ba ba ba ba baaa baaa baaa
Finallyyyy seeeeee the light
Guiding me through the night
With a dreamy touch, I take flight

[verse]
Wandering lost in thoughts
A journey through the unknown
A voice inside my head
Whispers to follow the glow

[chorus]
Ba ba ba ba ba ba baaa baaa baaa
Finallyyyy seeeeee the light
Leading me to a new day
With an ethereal grace, I'll be okay
