Lyrics :
[verse]
On a bus ride through the city's heart
Two souls met by chance, a brand new start
Raindrops tapping on the roof
Love bloomed fast, a proof

[chorus]
A gentle embrace, it wraps around
Like echoes of an old love found
Softly they linger, won't fade away
On this tender, timeless day

[verse]
With a borrowed ring and vows so true
They pledged their hearts amidst the few
Passengers cheered as the couple wed
In the glow of loveâ€™s purest red

[bridge]
So let the journey carry you
Through streets wide and avenues too
For in the moment, there's something true
A lifetime's touch, forever new

[chorus]
A gentle embrace, it wraps around
Like echoes of an old love found
Softly they linger, won't fade away
On this tender, timeless day
