Lyrics :
[Verse]
Beneath the sky of endless night
Where shadows dance in the pale moonlight
The echoes ring through the hollow halls
A hero rises, he stands tall

[Chorus]
Unleash the beast within
Feel the power coursing through your veins
With every breath we scream
Breaking free from chains

[Verse]
Steel hearts forged in fire's embrace
Warriors march to their destined place
In the heart of battle they find their might
A symphony of steel under starless skies

[Chorus]
Unleash the beast within
Feel the power coursing through your veins
With every breath we scream
Breaking free from chains

[Bridge]
Through the storm, through the pain
We fight on, never to fall again
