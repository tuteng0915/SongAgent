I’d like you to generate a song based on specific details I’m about to provide. The word "Cool" should be part of the title, and it will be sung from a male perspective. There’s also an English version of this song, so keep that in mind for stylistic consistency.
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Before we proceed, could you please specify the theme or message you want to convey through this song? Also, do you have any preferences for the genre or specific tags that should be included? This information will help me tailor the song more accurately to your vision.

The theme revolves around being in a mental hospital, with the music video's plot featuring a beautiful nurse who offers the protagonist two pills throughout the song. At the end, he finally chooses one pill, which holds some sort of significance or meaning. Can you create lyrics and tags for such a song?

[verse]
Woke up to the sound of a distant echo
In this place where shadows dance and time flows slow-mo
There's a nurse with eyes like morning skies
She holds two pills, choices in disguise

[chorus]
Cool is the calm before I choose my fate
Trapped between reality and what can't wait
With every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm walking on a tightrope, trying not to break

[verse]
Days blur into nights, dreams intertwine
A labyrinth of thoughts, searching for a sign
Her gentle voice cuts through the haze
"Choose wisely," she says, as if in a daze

[chorus]
Cool is the calm before I choose my fate
Trapped between reality and what can't wait
With every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm walking on a tightrope, trying not to break

[bridge]
One pill will heal, one pill will mend
Which path leads home? Where do I descend?
I close my eyes, let intuition guide
Feel the weight of worlds where truth may hide

[outro]
Now it's done, decision made, no turning back
Heart pounding loud, future wrapped in black
But peace descends, an unexpected grace
As cool takes over, replacing all that space
