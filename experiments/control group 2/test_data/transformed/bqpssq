Hey, song agent! I need your help to generate a song that matches these details. The song should have an indie rock vibe and feel like it was released in the last five years. The lyrics should convey a heartfelt message where the singer reassures their mom and sister not to be sad because they'll be with their father. Can you create something based on this?
