Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of dawn, as the shadows retreat,
A whisper of courage beneath my feet.
Through the valley of doubts, where the darkness had slept,
I walked with a spirit that never once wept.

[chorus]
Oh, the morning is breaking, painting skies anew,
With every step forward, hope shines through.
Guided by the sunlight, in hues so bright and true,
Each moment a canvas, painted in golden hue.

[verse]
Upon the winds of change, I set my sails,
Navigating dreams, overcoming trails.
The stars in their courses whispered my name,
In the heart of the night, no goal too lame.

[chorus]
Oh, the morning is breaking, painting skies anew,
With every step forward, hope shines through.
Guided by the sunlight, in hues so bright and true,
Each moment a canvas, painted in golden hue.

[bridge]
From the ashes of yesterday, rises a brand new day,
With promises of wonders, in every single way.
And though the path may twist, and uncertainties sway,
Hope remains steadfast, lighting up the way.

[chorus]
Oh, the morning is breaking, painting skies anew,
With every step forward, hope shines through.
Guided by the sunlight, in hues so bright and true,
Each moment a canvas, painted in golden hue.
