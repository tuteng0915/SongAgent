Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the snowy lane,
Christmas lights in every pane,
I can feel it in the air,
Magic's everywhere

[chorus]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
Let the bells ring out,
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
With joy there's no doubt,

[verse]
Underneath the mistletoe,
With you is where I want to go,
Let's dance the night away,
In this winter ballet

[chorus]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
Let the bells ring out,
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
With joy there's no doubt,

[bridge]
Oh oh oh, hear the children sing,
Fa la la, welcome winter's king,
Deck the halls with love and cheer,
Christmas time is here

[chorus]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
Let the bells ring out,
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,
With joy there's no doubt,
