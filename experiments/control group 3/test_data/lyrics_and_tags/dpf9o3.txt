Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down these familiar streets
Where shadows dance and memories speak
Every corner holds a tale so sweet
Of youthful dreams and hearts that beat

[chorus]
In this journey we call growing up
Through laughter, tears, and empty cups
We find ourselves in bittersweet change
With every heartbeat, love will arrange
And the seasons chaaahange!

[bridge]
And as the sun sets on our youth
We hold on tight to whispered truths
Time may pass, but moments stay
Guiding us through each brand new day
