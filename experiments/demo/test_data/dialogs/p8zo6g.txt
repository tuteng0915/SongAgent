That sounds like a cool mix of styles! To start, do you have any specific themes or emotions you'd like the lyrics to convey?
Agent : 
That's great to hear! To create the perfect song for you, could you please specify any particular themes or emotions you'd like the lyrics to convey? For example, do you want it to be uplifting and energetic, or more introspective and mellow? Any specific topics or feelings you'd like to express through the song?
User : 
I want it to feel powerful and anthemic, with a sense of longing and desire. Something that resonates emotionally but still fits the bold sound.

Great, we're going for a powerful and anthemic vibe with a touch of longing and desire. To ensure I capture your vision, let's aim for lyrics that reflect themes of yearning and aspiration but are set against bold, dynamic music. 

Before we proceed, could you also share if you prefer any particular subjects or imagery in the lyrics? For example, should they focus on personal growth, love, freedom, or something else?

Once I have this information, I'll generate the tags and lyrics for your song.

```
[verse]
In the shadows, I reach for the light,
A heart full of dreams in the dead of night.
Every echo calls me to be free,
Yearning for a world where I can see.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.

[verse]
Through the storm, we forge our path,
With every step, we redraw the map.
Eyes on the horizon, we're drawn to the flame,
Desires unspoken, yet none are the same.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.

[bridge]
The road is long, but we won't tire,
Fueled by passion, driven by fire.
Together we stand, forever we'll climb,
Reaching for glory, one more time.

[chorus]
Rise up, rise up, against the tide,
With every heartbeat, let hope collide.
We'll chase the sun, break through the skies,
Our spirits unbroken, our souls arise.
