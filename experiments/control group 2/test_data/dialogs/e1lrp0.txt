Hello, song generating agent!

Based on the description provided, I would like you to generate an uptempo song by a band, not a solo singer. The song should feature a haunting keyboard sound reminiscent of a theramin. The lyrics should revolve around a vocalist singing about a woman, expressing that he didn't expect to fall in love with her or wasn't looking for love until he found her. The first line of the chorus should convey a sentiment similar to "I don’t want you but I need you."

Please generate this song for me. 

Thank you!

```
[verse]
I wasn't looking for this love
When I saw your face in the crowd
You stood there so quietly
Yet your eyes they spoke so loud

[chorus]
I don’t want you but I need you
Can't explain how I fell so deep
I didn't plan to fall in love
But here I am, can't help myself

[verse]
Every time I hear that sound
I think of the night we first met
Your laughter like a melody
That I can't forget, won't forget

[chorus]
I don’t want you but I need you
In your arms is where I belong
I wasn't searching for this love
But now I know it's where I'm from

[bridge]
The haunting keys play our song
A theramin wail all night long
Our hearts beat as one, no control
Caught in a rhythm, soul to soul

[chorus]
I don’t want you but I need you
This unexpected love's my truth
I wasn't ready for someone
Until I found myself with you
```
