Hello, song generating agent!

Based on the description provided, I would like you to generate an uptempo song by a band, not a solo singer. The song should feature a haunting keyboard sound reminiscent of a theramin. The lyrics should revolve around a vocalist singing about a woman, expressing that he didn't expect to fall in love with her or wasn't looking for love until he found her. The first line of the chorus should convey a sentiment similar to "I donâ€™t want you but I need you."

Please generate this song for me. 

Thank you!
