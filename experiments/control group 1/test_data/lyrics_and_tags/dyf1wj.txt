Lyrics :
[Verse]
In a town not far away
A boy was born in a peculiar way
Covered in fur, oh so rare
With a heart as big as the open air

[Chorus]
Furry boy, don't you hide
You're a wonder, far and wide
In this world, you've got a place
With your wild smile and gentle grace

[Verse]
Growing up, he faced some strife
But his spirit was the light of life
In the fields, he'd dance and sing
Underneath the stars, where dreams take wing

[Bridge]
Oh, furry boy, you're one of a kind
Your story's unique, it's written in time
Don't let them bring you down
For you wear your difference with pride

[Chorus]
Furry boy, don't you hide
You're a wonder, far and wide
In this world, you've got a place
With your wild smile and gentle grace
