Lyrics :
[verse]
El the beatmaker in his zone
Drumsticks clickin' on the pad alone
Got this steel drum in my loop
Girls poppin' balloons to the groove

[chorus]
It's a YouTube vibe, Vimeo dream
Energetic scenes, popping at the seams
Quirky rhythms, we're shooting bows
Nostalgic feels with a fresh new glow

[verse]
Fiddlin' with keys, making samples sing
Backbeat's so loud, hear the steel drums ring
Arrows flying as we dance all night
Underneath the stars, everything feels right

[bridge]
Steel drums echo, reggae take control
Moombahton beats with a carefree soul
Shirts come off, balloons explode
Live experiments down this road

[chorus]
It's a YouTube vibe, Vimeo dream
Energetic scenes, popping at the seams
Quirky rhythms, we're shooting bows
Nostalgic feels with a fresh new glow
