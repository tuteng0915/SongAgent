Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I feel the world open wide.
Every shadow, every fight,
Fades away as I turn inside.

[Chorus]
I'm flying free, above the clouds so high,
No chains to hold me down, no need to say goodbye.
With every breath, I touch the sky,
In this journey of self-discovery, I learn to fly.

[Bridge]
Through the storms, through the calm I glide,
Finding pieces of myself in the tide.
Each moment a step, each step a guide,
To who I am, where I belong, my spirit will not hide.
