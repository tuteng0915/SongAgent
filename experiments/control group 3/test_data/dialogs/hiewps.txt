I'm looking for a punk/alternative song that's soft and emotional, with a powerful build-up. Can you help me with that?

Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about what you're looking for in terms of the lyrics and any specific themes or emotions you want to express?
User : 
I want it to tell a story, something heartfelt. It's about a father singing to his son about the son's mother, who has passed away. Could you include details about their meeting and her illness? And maybe some life lessons about love and loss?

I've crafted a song that tells the heartfelt story you described, with themes of love, loss, and cherished memories. Here's a snippet of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I remember her smile,
A dance in the rain, our first meeting, so wild.
She fought with all she had, but fate took its toll,
Now it's just you and me, son, filling the void in our soul.

[chorus]
Oh, love, it burns like a flame,
In the ashes, our memories remain.
Through loss, we learn to grow,
Her legacy, in our hearts, we'll sow.
```

In the quiet of the night, I remember her smile,
A dance in the rain, our first meeting, so wild.
She fought with all she had, but fate took its toll,
Now it's just you and me, son, filling the void in our soul.

[chorus]
Oh, love, it burns like a flame,
In the ashes, our memories remain.
Through loss, we learn to grow,
Her legacy, in our hearts, we'll sow.

[verse]
She taught us to stand tall, even when we fall down,
To cherish every moment, for life's a fragile crown.
Though she's gone, her spirit lives on, in you and me,
Together we'll face the world, forever we'll be free.

[bridge]
And though the pain never fully fades away,
We find strength in each other, come what may.
With every tear, there's a lesson learned,
In this journey of love, where hearts are eternally yearned.

[chorus]
Oh, love, it burns like a flame,
In the ashes, our memories remain.
Through loss, we learn to grow,
Her legacy, in our hearts, we'll sow.
The lyrics and the tags are just what I wanted. The song has a punk/alternative feel with an emotional touch, and the lyrics beautifully capture the story of love and loss. Thank you for this.

I think we're ready to generate the song now.
