Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the storm, I rise
With every challenge, I grow wise
In the heart of night, I find my light
I am unstoppable tonight

[chorus]
Celebrate the journey, every step of the way
From the darkest nights to the brightest days
We've come so far, we've broken free
Let's celebrate who we're meant to be

[verse]
With hope as my guide, I'll never fall
For every mountain, there's a call
To reach new heights, to touch the sky
And paint my dreams where eagles fly

[chorus]
Celebrate the journey, every step of the way
From the darkest nights to the brightest days
We've come so far, we've broken free
Let's celebrate who we're meant to be

[bridge]
Every tear has washed away the fear
And every smile is a victory here
Together we stand, hand in hand
Building castles in life's shifting sand

[chorus]
Celebrate the journey, every step of the way
From the darkest nights to the brightest days
We've come so far, we've broken free
Let's celebrate who we're meant to be

[outro]
The sun will rise, the shadows pass
Each moment fleeting, like breaths of glass
Embrace the now, let futures unfurl
Here's to life, to us, to the world
