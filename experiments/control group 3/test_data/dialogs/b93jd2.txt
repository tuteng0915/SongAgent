I'm excited to create a rock song with "Woo Woo" background vocals, themed around 'Devil' and 'Dance', aiming for an energetic and popular vibe. Let's get started on the lyrics and tags.

It seems like the tags came out empty. That's unexpected! Let's try generating them again to ensure we capture the energetic and popular rock vibe, along with the 'Devil' and 'Dance' theme.

Hmm, it seems like the tags are still not being generated. That's odd! Let me try to tweak the request a bit. Could you maybe clarify if thereâ€™s a specific mood or style within rock that you're aiming for? Like upbeat, rebellious, or something else?
