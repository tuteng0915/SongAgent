Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits the vibe of something from the early 2000s or late 90s. The voice should have that distinct computer-generated feel, and I’m not sure if it’s male or female—so maybe we can play around with both? As for the video concept, I’d like it to be similar to *"Wear Sunscreen"* with random shots throughout. Let's create something nostalgic yet fresh! Can you work your magic and generate this for me?
