Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that reminds me of kids or teenage years, specifically involving school. The vibe should be something from around 2010-2014, and it would be great if the intro could feel familiar, like it's been used in multiple songs before. Let's create something that captures those nostalgic vibes of youth and school life! Can you work your magic and come up with some lyrics and tags for this kind of song?

I've crafted a song that should resonate with the nostalgic vibes of youth and school life from the 2010-2014 era. Here are the lyrics I came up with:

[verse]
Woke up to the sound of my old alarm clock
Pages of my textbook waiting to be unlocked
Backpack on my shoulder, yeah, I'm ready to go
To a place where dreams are born, and we all grow

[chorus]
Oh, these are the days that we won't forget
Chasing our dreams, no regrets
In this classroom, we find our way
Learning lessons every day

[bridge]
Remember scribbling notes in the margins
Laughing 'bout the things we did last weekend
Friends by our side, through thick and thin
This is our time, let the memories begin

[chorus]
Oh, these are the days that we won't forget
Chasing our dreams, no regrets
In this classroom, we find our way
Learning lessons every day

[outro]
So here's to the friends and the times we've had
To the future we dream of, it's not so bad
With a little bit of hope and a lot of fun
We'll keep moving forward, till our journey's done

The tags for this song are set to capture the essence of those years: nostalgia, school, youth, 2010-2014, pop, acoustic, catchy, upbeat.
