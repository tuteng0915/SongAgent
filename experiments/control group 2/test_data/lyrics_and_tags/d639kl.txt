[intro]
*ka-ching* (cashier machine sound)

[verse]
Money, money, money
Reverberating through the night
Money, money, money
In the soft glow of moonlight

[chorus]
Money money money
An endless loop of desire
Money money money
Setting my soul on fire

[bridge]
Guitar riff solo

[chorus]
Money money money
An endless loop of desire
Money money money
Setting my soul on fire

[outro]
Money... money...
