Lyrics :
[Verse]
In Munich city where the beers flow
Rosie danced with another beau
Underneath the Bavarian sky
A tale of love gone awry

[Chorus]
Prost to Rosie, cheers go round
Though her heart played a cheating sound
Feel the beat, let's not be glum
Oktoberfest is here, come have some fun

[Bridge]
In dirndls twirling, oompah band plays
Forget that girl, join in the craze
Raise your steins high, forget the disdain
Tomorrow's a new day, love will remain

[Chorus]
Prost to Rosie, cheers go round
Though her heart played a cheating sound
Feel the beat, let's not be glum
Oktoberfest is here, come have some fun

[Outro]
Years may pass but memories stay
Of Rosie and that fateful day
In Munich city where the beers flow
We partied on, let troubles go
