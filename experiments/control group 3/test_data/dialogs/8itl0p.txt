I want a song with a rock vibe and some dubstep elements in the chorus, like a "wub wub" sound, but not full dubstep. It should feel like it's from around 2012. Can you do that?

Sure, I can create a song with a rock vibe and some dubstep elements in the chorus for you. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about your preferences? For example, do you have any favorite artists or songs from that era that you'd like me to draw inspiration from? Also, what kind of mood or theme are you aiming for with this song?
User : 
The song should feel like breaking free or liberation, with a catchy and radio-friendly tone. Something that could fit well on rock radio stations from 2012. The energy should be high, especially in the chorus where it feels like walls are coming down. Does that help?

I've crafted a song that aligns with your vision of liberation and high energy, incorporating rock elements with some dubstep vibes in the chorus, reminiscent of 2012. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Waking up to the sound of chains breaking
Sunlight's streaming through the cracks in the walls
Every heartbeat, every breath I'm taking
Is a step closer to freedom's call

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless

[verse]
Shadows fade as we step into the light
Voices echo through the canyon walls
With every stride, we claim our right
To be free, to answer freedom's call

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless

[bridge]
The weight is gone, we're standing tall
No more limits, no more fall
Together we forge what once was past
Into a future that will forever last

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless

The lyrics and tags look great! I think this captures the vibe I was going for. The "wub wub" in the chorus adds that dubstep touch without overpowering the rock feel, and the theme of breaking free fits perfectly with the energy I wanted. Let's generate the song!

Awesome! The song has been generated. It's got the rock vibe with just the right amount of dubstep influence, and the lyrics really capture that feeling of liberation. The tags also align perfectly with the 2012 era and the high-energy tone we were aiming for. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to tweak or if you're ready to rock out to this track! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ”¥
