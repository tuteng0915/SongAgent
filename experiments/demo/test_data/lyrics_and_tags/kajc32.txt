Lyrics :
[verse]
In the silence of the evening
I remember your sweet laughter
But now it's just a distant echo
A memory that won't come back

[chorus]
Lost in the shadows of our past
Dreams we once held, fading fast
Every step I take without you
Feels like walking through the misty rain

[verse]
Photos fade and so does the pain
Yet your memory remains
In every corner, in every whisper
Of the wind that carries your name

[chorus]
Lost in the shadows of our past
Dreams we once held, fading fast
Every step I take without you
Feels like walking through the misty rain

[bridge]
Why do you come here, and...
Time moves on, but I'm standing still
Hoping to hear your voice again
Though I know it's futile, I can't help but feel
This aching void where love had been

[chorus]
Lost in the shadows of our past
Dreams we once held, fading fast
Every step I take without you
Feels like walking through the misty rain

[outro]
And as the night embraces me
I close my eyes and there you'll be
Forever etched within my soul
A love story with no final page
