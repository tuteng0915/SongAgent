Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

I’d like you to generate a song that matches the following description. The genre should be pop/rock/alternative, ideally with a male singer—possibly British or American. The tone of the song should reflect an emotional narrative arc: starting with urgency and concern, transitioning into happiness and love, then shifting toward tension, manipulation, and heartbreak, and finally ending on a haunting, cyclical note.  

The lyrics should tell this story:  
- It begins with a man encountering a woman who is in distress—he finds her on a rooftop about to jump after her shoe falls down. He intervenes and saves her.  
- They start a relationship, which starts off beautifully but becomes complicated as she grows possessive, manipulative, and emotionally volatile.  
- Eventually, they fight and break up, leaving both parties broken.  
- In the end, the woman returns to the same rooftop, now looking down at another person below, repeating the same action by dropping her shoe again, hinting at a tragic cycle.  

Can you create something that captures these themes while staying within the style I mentioned?
