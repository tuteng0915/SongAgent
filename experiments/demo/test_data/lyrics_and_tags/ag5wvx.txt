[intro]
ha ha, ha ha, mmhmm, mmhmm

[verse 1]
There once was an elephant who loved to dance,
In a tutu so bright, he had his chance,
At the jungle fest, he made his stand,
With a wiggle and a wag, he rocked the land.

[chorus]
Rockin' elephant, tutu clad,
Shaking tail, looking rad,
Trumpet solo, oh what a show,
Dancing through the jungle, stealing the glow.

[verse 2]
He stomped and he twirled under neon skies,
With every spin, the crowd's surprise,
Guitar riffs echoed his mighty name,
Elvis the elephant, no one's the same.

[bridge]
Do you think it’s that easy, to be a star?
Do you really think it’s true, that fame's not far?
Look at Elvis, dancing free,
Who would've thought, wild as can be!

[chorus]
Rockin' elephant, tutu clad,
Shaking tail, looking rad,
Trumpet solo, oh what a show,
Dancing through the jungle, stealing the glow.
