Hey song agent, I need a song that's indie folk style, with a focus on unrequited love and determination. Can you start with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can start with that. Let me set the tags and lyrics for you.

 [verse]
In the quiet of the morning light
I see your shadow, it's my guiding light
Though you'll never know my heart's desire
I still walk on through the night

[chorus]
With a heart full of dreams and a soul set free
I love you more than you'll ever see
Against all odds, I stand my ground
Unrequited love, where I am bound

[bridge]
But I won't give in to the silence
Even when hope is lost in the distance
For every step I take without you
Is a testament to what I must do

[chorus]

What do you think? The name part can be tweaked later. Should we add anything else?
Agent : 
The tags and lyrics look great so far! The theme of unrequited love and determination is well-reflected in both. 

Before we proceed to generate the song, let's see if there's anything else you'd like to add or modify. Do you want any specific changes to the lyrics? Or perhaps additional elements in the music, like adding strings or piano to complement the acoustic guitar?

Let me know what you think so we can make this song perfect for you!
User : 
The lyrics are good, but can we add some strings to the music? Something subtle.
Agent :

Great! I've added "subtle strings" to the tags, which should give the music a richer texture while keeping it in the background.

If there's nothing else you'd like to add or change, remember to press the "generate" button to manually generate the song. 

Let me know if there's anything else you need!

The tags now include "subtle strings." I think we're good to go. Let's generate the song!

Alright, the song is all set and ready to be generated! Let me know if you need anything else in the future. Cheers!
