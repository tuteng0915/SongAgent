Sure! Here's my request to the song-generating agent based on your requirements:

---

I’d like you to generate a heartfelt, bittersweet country-style song. The scene is set with a woman moving away, packing her car as she prepares to leave. A guy watches her from a window, quietly reflecting on his long-standing crush on her—feelings he never acted upon. Adding to the emotional depth, there’s another woman standing beside him, who has secretly loved *him* for years but hasn’t said anything either. 

The lyrics should capture their unspoken emotions, regrets, and longing. If possible, name the song after one of the women or repeat her name in the chorus. Make it poignant yet relatable, with vivid imagery that brings this moment to life.

Can you create something like that?

[verse]
She packs her dreams in that old suitcase,
Rain starts to fall as she closes the gate.
He watches from the window, too shy to speak,
Years of silence, secrets he'll keep.

[chorus]
Oh, Caroline, don't drive away,
Caroline, let me say what I should've said yesterday.
The wind carries whispers of what could've been,
But now it's too late, and regret's where love's been.

[verse]
Beside him stands another kind of grace,
Her own heart aching, hidden in plain sight.
Years spent loving him, wordlessly true,
But his eyes follow Caroline; there's nothing she can do.

[chorus]
Oh, Caroline, don't drive away,
Caroline, let me say what I should've said yesterday.
The wind carries whispers of what could've been,
But now it's too late, and regret's where love's been.

[bridge]
Two hearts break while one car pulls away,
A quiet goodbye on this melancholy day.
Unspoken words hang heavy in the air,
Love lost before they even knew it was there.

[chorus]
Oh, Caroline, don't drive away,
Caroline, let me say what I should've said yesterday.
The wind carries whispers of what could've been,
But now it's too late, and regret's where love's been.

[outro]
Her tires hum with the weight of goodbyes,
And two souls left behind watch the dust slowly rise.
