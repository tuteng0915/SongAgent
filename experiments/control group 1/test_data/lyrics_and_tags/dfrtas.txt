Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the night
Where ghouls and ghosts take flight
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
[verse]
The moon is full, casting spells
The witching hour tolls its bells
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
[bridge]
Trick or treat, in disguise
Mysteries under pumpkin skies
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
