Hello, song generating agent! I would like you to create a song for me with the following features:

The lyrics should include phrases like "You! Are always in my mind" or "You'll be...", "You were the best thing in my life". The first word of the refrain should start with the highest note and every subsequent word should probably go one note lower, ideally in a triplet tempo.

The singer's voice should be deep, reminiscent of Phil Collins or Elvis Presley, but even more manly.

Could you please generate a song based on these requirements?

I have generated a song based on your requirements. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
You'll be the reason I'm alive
You were the best thing in my life

[chorus]
YOU! Are always in my mind
Every breath you take, every move you make
I fall for you all over again

[bridge]
In your eyes, I see forever
In your arms, I've found my home

[chorus]
YOU! Are always in my mind
Every heartbeat whispers your name
In your love, I have found my sanctuary

The tags for the style of the song include a deep voice reminiscent of Phil Collins and Elvis Presley, but even more manly, with a triplet tempo and the highest note at the start of the refrain.
