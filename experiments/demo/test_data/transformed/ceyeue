Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that captures a specific vibe I have in mind. It should have a Dido/Alanis Morisette feel, with a strong pop essence. The visual concept is uniqueâ€”imagine a solo artist in a field, slowly floating upwards towards the sky as the music progresses. Can you help me create something like this?
