Lyrics :
[verse]
Remember those summer nights
We'd chase the setting sun
Our hearts were wild and free
But now you're gone

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back

[verse]
These streets remain the same
But everything feels wrong
Without you by my side
Where did you go?

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back

[bridge]
The memories linger on
In every corner of this town
I'm searching for a way
To turn back time somehow

[chorus]
Take me back back back to the days of us
When love was all we thought about
Every moment, every touch
I need you now, take me back back back
