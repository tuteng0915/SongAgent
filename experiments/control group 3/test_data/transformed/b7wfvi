Request to the song generating agent:  

I’d like you to generate a song based on specific details I’m about to provide. The word "Cool" should be part of the title, and it will be sung from a male perspective. There’s also an English version of this song, so keep that in mind for stylistic consistency.  

The theme revolves around being in a mental hospital, with the music video's plot featuring a beautiful nurse who offers the protagonist two pills throughout the song. At the end, he finally chooses one pill, which holds some sort of significance or meaning. Can you create lyrics and tags for such a song?
