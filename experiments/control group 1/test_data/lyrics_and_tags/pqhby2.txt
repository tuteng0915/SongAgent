Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the shadows where heroes fall
A symphony of silence calls
War drums pounding, the march begins
Swords of destiny, the die is cast

[Chorus]
Rise like fire from the ashes
With every heartbeat, courage clashes
The night is ours, we'll make it last
United we stand, against the past

[Bridge]
Beneath the skies of burning red
We forge ahead, though hope may thread
Our spirits soar on wings of steel
Echoes ring through valleys deep

[Chorus]
Rise like fire from the ashes
With every heartbeat, courage clashes
The night is ours, we'll make it last
United we stand, against the past
