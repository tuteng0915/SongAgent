Lyrics :
[verse]
In the rain, she slipped away
Her voice, a whisper against the pain
'Hold me close,' she softly said
As flashing lights danced on her face instead

[chorus]
The guilt that I bear, like shadows in the air
I couldn't save her, my love, my only care
With every drop of rain, I feel the stain
Of words unspoken, now forever forsaken

[verse]
Each word a beacon in the darkened skies
A fleeting moment as life bids goodbye
I reach for her hand, but it fades to mist
The sound of sirens, dreams amiss

[bridge]
And if I could turn back time
To rewrite our stars, realign
I'd brave any storm, face any fight
To hear once more 'I love you,' under the moonlight

[chorus]
The guilt that I bear, like shadows in the air
I couldn't save her, my love, my only care
With every drop of rain, I feel the stain
Of words unspoken, now forever forsaken
