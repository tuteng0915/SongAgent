Great! We've set the tags for your song to "sad, eerie, emo, punk". Now let's work on some lyrics that match this vibe. I'll draft a verse and chorus to get us started.

I've set the initial lyrics for your song. Here's what we have so far:

[verse]
In the shadows where whispers reside,
I find my solace, where darkness meets the sky.

[chorus]
Eyes of despair, in a world so cold,
We scream our silence, stories untold.
