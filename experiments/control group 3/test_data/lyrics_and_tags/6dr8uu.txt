Lyrics :
[verse]
You said we'd stand side by side
In this journey, through thick and thin
But now I see the lies in your eyes
The promises we made, they're breaking in the wind

[chorus]
Betrayed, I feel so betrayed
By those I called my friends
We had a bond that can't be swayed
But now it's come to an end

[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Where echoes of our laughter meet
I'm left with shadows of yesterday
Trying to find my way

[pre-chorus]
Overheard whispers in the hall
Gossip spreads like a fireball
Closing doors, sealing fate
No turning back, too late

[chorus]
Betrayed, I feel so betrayed
By those I called my friends
We had a bond that can't be swayed
But now it's come to an end

[bridge]
The sting of deceit cuts deep inside
A wound that time cannot hide
Trust shattered, dreams collide
In silence, I let the tears decide

[chorus]
Betrayed, I feel so betrayed
By those I called my friends
We had a bond that can't be swayed
But now it's come to an end
