Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the city lights,
Neon shining in my eyes,
Every corner calls my name,
In this rhythm, I'm not the same.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.

[verse]
Shadows move with every sound,
The city's heartbeat all around,
Feel the rush, it's taking me,
To a world where dreams are free.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.

[bridge]
Underneath the starlit glow,
Where the night and secrets flow,
Time stands still, we lose control,
In this dance, we find our soul.

[chorus]
We're dancing under neon skies,
Electric beats keep us alive,
Pulse is racing, hearts collide,
In this moment, we come alive.
