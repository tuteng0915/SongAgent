Lyrics :
[verse]
If you find a - letter under the mattress, please don't read it & just leave it alone.
These secrets buried deep, they're not yours to own,
Time has locked them away, let the silence atone.

[chorus]
It's not the same without you,
Empty rooms echo too true,
It's not the same without you,
The shadows dance, but we've withdrawn from the view.

[verse]
I trace the lines of memories etched in the walls,
Every corner whispers your name as it falls,
This house still echoes your voice, every sigh,
A ghost of the past that I can't even try.

[chorus]
It's not the same without you,
Empty rooms echo too true,
It's not the same without you,
The shadows dance, but we've withdrawn from the view.

[bridge]
And if I could turn back time,
Rewrite our story line by line,
Would it bring us closer or tear us apart?
Still searching for answers in the dark.

[chorus]
It's not the same without you,
Empty rooms echo too true,
It's not the same without you,
The shadows dance, but we've withdrawn from the view.
