Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, it's the sound of the streets, story untold,
In the heart of the city where the nights unfold,
With a mic in my hand, I'm ready to spit,
Rhymes so sharp, they cut like a blade, legit

[chorus]
This is for the ones who dream in the dark,
Lighting up the shadows with a spark,
For the hustlers and grinders, keep climbing the chart,
Early 90s flow, straight from the heart

[verse]
Concrete jungle, where the wild things play,
Every corner holds a tale, every alleyway,
From the rooftops to the subway trains,
The rhythm of life, through joy and pain

[bridge]
Jazz loops looping, scratches deep,
In this sonic journey, secrets we keep,
Turntables spinning, beats never sleep,
In this world of ours, memories we reap

[chorus]
This is for the ones who dream in the dark,
Lighting up the shadows with a spark,
For the hustlers and grinders, keep climbing the chart,
Early 90s flow, straight from the heart
