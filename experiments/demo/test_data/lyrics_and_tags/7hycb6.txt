Lyrics :
[verse]
Snowflakes dance in the crisp night air,
Lights twinkle, reflections everywhere.

[chorus]
Oh, what fun, the holidays are here,
Trumpets play, spreading cheer, so clear.

[verse]
Underneath the starlit sky so bright,
We gather 'round on this holy night.

[chorus]
Oh, what fun, the holidays are here,
Brass bands play, joy and love we share.

[bridge]
Laughter fills the frosty air,
Magic's in the moments that we share.
