Lyrics :
[intro]
"I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus"
"Could you describe the ruckus?"

[verse]
Ruckus in the night, shadows come to life
Screams of chaos echo, cutting like a knife
City streets ignite, flames begin to rise
Fight or flight kicks in, as we improvise

[chorus]
Feel the power surge, it's time to break free
Unleash the beast within, let the fury run wild in me
Loud guitars screech, as we scream out loud
This is our battle cry, standing fierce and proud

[verse]
Adrenaline rush, hearts pounding fast
Fists clenched tight, we're ready to blast
Through the chaos we carve our way
No surrender, no retreat, we'll seize the day

[chorus]
Feel the power surge, it's time to break free
Unleash the beast within, let the fury run wild in me
Loud guitars screech, as we scream out loud
This is our battle cry, standing fierce and proud

[bridge]
The storm has arrived, skies are torn apart
In this moment of truth, we bare our hearts
With every fiber, with every breath
We'll fight until there's nothing left

[chorus]
Feel the power surge, it's time to break free
Unleash the beast within, let the fury run wild in me
Loud guitars screech, as we scream out loud
This is our battle cry, standing fierce and proud
