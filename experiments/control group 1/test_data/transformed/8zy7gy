Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a very specific vibe. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should have piano playing chords as part of its instrumentation, and the overall tone should be relatively upbeat. The style should feel like it’s from the late 70s or early 80s—think retro but timeless. It doesn’t need to sound *too* polished; maybe even something that could’ve been a modest hit or a one-hit wonder for a band back then.  

The subject matter is where it gets fun—it should be atypical, not your typical love song or party anthem. Maybe something about science, math, or technology? And if you can weave in an undertone of fear or unease, that would be perfect. Oh, and I imagine the title might follow a simple structure like “The _______ Song” (fill-in-the-blank style).  

Can you help me create something along those lines? Let’s see some lyrics and tags!
