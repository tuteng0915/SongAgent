Hey, song generating agent! I need your help creating a song based on a music video concept that’s been stuck in my head. Here’s the idea:

The song should feel like an upbeat pop track with a catchy rhythm, something that could have come out around 2014 or 2015. It opens with a scene of a kid riding his skateboard, then transitions to a vibrant laundromat filled with quirky characters—a lady carrying a birdcage, some guys with glitter and braids, and more. There’s also this girl who’s clearly frustrated with her boyfriend; she slaps his phone out of his hand to get his attention.

Then, the skateboard kid enters, starts doing laundry, and suddenly becomes the center of attention when the rude girl begins flirting/dancing with him. Meanwhile, at the front of the laundromat stands the band (the lead singer has curly hair), almost like they’re guarding the room as everyone starts dancing wildly. At the end, the kid and the rude girl sneak out together while the party continues behind them.

Can you generate a song that fits this vibe? Something fun, flirty, and full of energy—perfect for a chaotic yet joyful laundromat dance party! Let me know what you come up with!
