Got it! Let me start by checking if you have any specific theme or mood in mind for the songâ€”like is it romantic, sad, or more upbeat?

the user has not given their preferences yet.
Sure thing! Since you haven't specified a theme or mood yet, how about we go for something romantic? I'll generate a song with that in mind. Let me set the tags and lyrics for you.

I'll proceed to set the tags and lyrics now.

**Lyrics:**
```
[verse]
In the quiet of the evening, beneath the starlit sky,
I found my heart in your eyes, where forever I would lie.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.

[verse]
Whispers of time fade away, as moments stand still,
Hand in hand, we walk this path, our hearts ready to fill.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.

[bridge]
And if the world should crumble down,
Our love will rise, above all sound.
Through storms and shadows, we'll never part,
Bound by the strings of a tender heart.

[chorus]
Love's sweet melody, it carries us away,
On wings of dreams, through night and day.
With every beat, with every sigh,
Together we'll dance under the moonlit sky.
