I'm excited to help you create this song! Let's start by focusing on the core theme or emotion you want the lyrics to convey. Since you're aiming for a cowboy-like, rugged feel, should the lyrics tell a story of adventure, heartbreak, or perhaps resilience?
Agent : 
That sounds like a great direction! For a cowboy-like, rugged feel, storytelling is key. Let's go with a theme of **resilience**â€”a story about overcoming challenges and staying true to oneself in the face of adversity. This can include elements of adventure and heartbreak but will ultimately emphasize strength and perseverance.

I'll set the tags and lyrics for this theme. Let me do that now.

[verse]  
Through desert sands and canyon wide,  
A lone soul rides with nothing but pride.  
The sun beats down, his shadow fades,  
But he don't stop, no debts left unpaid.  

[chorus]  
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,  
In this wild world, you're never alone.  
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,  
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.  

[verse]  
He lost it all, love turned to dust,  
Dreams fell apart, yeah, life ain't just.  
Yet every scar tells what he's worth,  
A fighter's heart beneath the hurt.  

[chorus]  
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,  
In this wild world, you're never alone.  
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,  
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.  

[bridge]  
Mountains crumble, rivers dry,  
But a man's resolve will never die.  
With each new dawn, there comes a fight,  
And hope burns bright even through the night.  

[chorus]  
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,  
In this wild world, you're never alone.  
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,  
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.
