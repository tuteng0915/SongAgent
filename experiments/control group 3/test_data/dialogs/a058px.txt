Sure thing! Let's start by focusing on the vibe and the singer. I'll aim for an upbeat pop song with a female singer who has a mid-range voice. Does that sound good to kick off?

Great! With that direction, I'll set the initial tags for our upbeat pop song with a female singer. Let's also define some basic lyrics to get us started. Here’s what I’m thinking:

For the tags: `upbeat, pop, female singer, mid-range voice`

And for the lyrics:
```
[Verse]
She walks in the room, lights up the place
Everybody turns, she's got that grace

[Chorus]
Oh, she's the one, shining so bright
In this world of darkness, she's our light

[Bridge]
With every step she takes, hearts mend
Her smile could change the world, my friend
```

Once you confirm these details or suggest any changes, we can proceed by pressing the "generate" button to create the song.

The tags and lyrics have been set successfully. If you're happy with these details, you can now press the "generate" button to create our upbeat pop song featuring a female singer with a mid-range voice. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust before we proceed!
User : 
The lyrics and tags sound good so far. Let's move forward with adding the trumpet feature. It should appear in certain parts of the song, but not the chorus. Can we work on that next?
Agent : 
Sure thing! To add the trumpet feature, we’ll need to specify where it should appear. Since you mentioned it shouldn’t be in the chorus, let’s plan to include it in the verse and bridge sections.

I'll update the lyrics to indicate when the trumpet should come in:

```
[Verse]
She walks in the room, lights up the place (Trumpet)
Everybody turns, she's got that grace (Trumpet)

[Chorus]
Oh, she's the one, shining so bright
In this world of darkness, she's our light

[Bridge]
With every step she takes, hearts mend (Trumpet)
Her smile could change the world, my friend (Trumpet)
```

Once these adjustments are set, we can generate the song. Let’s go ahead and make these changes.

The lyrics have been updated to include the trumpet feature in the verse and bridge sections. 

Now, let's also add "trumpet" to our tags to ensure it gets included in the instrumental arrangement. I'll update the tags accordingly.

The tags have been updated to include the trumpet. Now we're all set with both lyrics and tags reflecting the inclusion of the trumpet feature in the verse and bridge sections.

You can now press the "generate" button to create the song with these new adjustments. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to tweak before proceeding!
User : 
The addition of the trumpet sounds perfect. However, I recall wanting the trumpet riff to repeat in three sets of four repetitions: the first two sets sounding similar and the last set being different. Can we incorporate that detail next?
Agent : 
Absolutely, let's refine the inclusion of the trumpet to match your vision. We'll modify the lyrics to indicate the pattern of the trumpet riff: two sets of four repetitions that are similar, followed by a third set that is different.

Here’s how we can adjust the lyrics:

```
[Verse]
She walks in the room, lights up the place (Trumpet x4)
Everybody turns, she's got that grace (Trumpet x4)

[Chorus]
Oh, she's the one, shining so bright
In this world of darkness, she's our light

[Bridge]
With every step she takes, hearts mend (Trumpet x4)
Her smile could change the world, my friend (Trumpet x4, different)
```

Let's update these details and then you can press the "generate" button to create the song with the refined trumpet feature.
