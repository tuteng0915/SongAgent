Sure, I can create a song with a 90s to mid-2000s vibe for you. To ensure it matches your taste, could you please specify some of your music preferences? For instance, do you prefer pop, rock, or another genre from that era? Also, any favorite artists or specific styles you'd like me to consider?
If you don't have specific preferences, I'll go ahead and create something based on popular trends from that time.

I've set up a song with a 90s to mid-2000s vibe, incorporating elements like pop rock, acoustic guitar, synthesizers, and a catchy melody. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the radio
Playing those songs we used to know
Every note a memory, every chord a trace
Of the days we lived without a care in the world

[chorus]
We'll dance like nobody's watching
Sing like we're part of the band
In this moment, nothing else matters
Just you and me and the music in our hands

[verse]
Walking down the streets where we used to roam
Feeling that freedom, we were never alone
With the sun setting, painting colors in the sky
Our hearts beating as one, under neon lights

[chorus]
We'll dance like nobody's watching
Sing like we're part of the band
In this moment, nothing else matters
Just you and me and the music in our hands

[bridge]
Time may pass, but some things remain
The echoes of laughter, the rhythm of rain
In the soundtrack of our lives, these moments stay
Forever young, forever okay

[chorus]
We'll dance like nobody's watching
Sing like we're part of the band
In this moment, nothing else matters
Just you and me and the music in our hands

[outro]
So let's hold on to this feeling tonight
Let the past guide us through the light
Together we'll keep these memories alive
In the timeless journey of life
