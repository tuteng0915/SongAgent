Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the evening
Beneath the crimson sky
I see her silhouette fading
The look in her eyes as she's turning away
We dance to a silent waltz
A serenade in shadows gray
Her steps whisper secrets
Of dreams that are going away

[chorus]
Oh love don't let me go
Through the winds of change we'll flow
With every heartbeat we ignite
The fire that will light our way
And though she may be far
Our spirits will never part
For love is a song that will always stay

[bridge]
Between two worlds we linger
Caught in time's embrace
But the sun will rise tomorrow
And paint a new day's face

[chorus]
Oh love don't let me go
Through the winds of change we'll flow
With every heartbeat we ignite
The fire that will light our way
And though she may be far
Our spirits will never part
For love is a song that will always stay
