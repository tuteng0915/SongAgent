Hey there! I understand you're trying to find a song that's been stuck in your head, but how about we take those details and create something new instead? Let's craft a soft rock ballad with a dramatic tone, perfect for pivotal movie moments. The style will feature a male vocalist, mainly driven by piano, with an emotive chorus that repeats a line like "Don't let me goooooooo" (or maybe "down," "drown," or "die"). It'll have that timeless, cinematic feel.

Can you generate a song based on these features?
