Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the shadows where the rebels hide,
Voices echo, side by side.
Chains will break, we'll rise above,
Fighting for the dream we love.

[Chorus]
Screaming at the top of your lungs,
Do what you want, do what you want.
Freedom calls, we won't back down,
Through the chaos, hear the sound.
Rebel hearts, we'll never conform,
Punk rock souls, we'll weather the storm.

[Bridge]
Came to some kind of fight,
They try to silence our cries.
But we'll stand tall, reach for the skies.
Together strong, united we stand,
With every note, reclaim our land.
