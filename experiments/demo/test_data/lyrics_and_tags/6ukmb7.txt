Lyrics :
[Verse]
Woke up this mornin', sun shining bright,
Got my boots on, ready to fight.
Ain't no mountain high enough to keep me down,
Write me a letter, tell me you're doin' all right.

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm feeling alright, yeah, I'm feeling so fine,
With a little bit of rhythm, and a whole lot of time.
Shake it off, let the good times roll,
Doin' all right, steady as a goal.

[Bridge]
Through the highs and the lows, I keep on singing,
Motown grooves, with a heart that's swinging.
Retro beats, in my veins they flow,
In every step, in every glow.

[Chorus]
Oh, we're feeling alright, yeah, we're feeling so fine,
With a little bit of rhythm, and a whole lot of time.
Shake it off, let the good times roll,
Doin' all right, steady as a goal.
