Lyrics :
[verse]
Oh oh feeeoline,
I've been lost since the days gone by,
Walking down this lonely road,
Underneath the open sky.

[chorus]
Guide me home, through the night,
Be my beacon, be my light,
In this world of fleeting time,
Hold me close, let us align.

[verse]
Rivers flow and winds they sing,
Stories of the wandering,
Every step a memory,
In the heart where shadows cling.

[bridge]
And if the stars should fall tonight,
We'll find our way, we'll be alright,
Together bound by threads unseen,
In this dance of life, serene.

[chorus]
Guide me home, through the night,
Be my beacon, be my light,
In this world of fleeting time,
Hold me close, let us align.
