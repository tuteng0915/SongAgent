Lyrics :
[verse]
Out on the prairie where the wild winds blow
There's a spirit of adventure that every cowboy knows
With his hat pulled low and spurs jingling high
He rides into the sunset with dreams in his eye

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton'
Cities we roam, but the range is our home
Underneath the starlit sky so wide
We ride forever with the freedom inside

[verse]
Rodeo nights and campfire glows
Stories of old from the trail we chose
Boots tapping rhythm as the band starts to play
In this life of motion, there's no better way

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton'
Cities we roam, but the range is our home
Underneath the starlit sky so wide
We ride forever with the freedom inside

[bridge]
The dust may settle, but the legends remain
In every heart that hears the whistle of the train
From Amarillo down to Abilene
The cowboy's song is the soul of the scene

[chorus]
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton'
Cities we roam, but the range is our home
Underneath the starlit sky so wide
We ride forever with the freedom inside

[outro]
So here's to the riders who chase the sun
To the ones who are gone and the battles they've won
May their spirits live on in each hoofbeat's sound
In the heart of Texas, where legends are found
