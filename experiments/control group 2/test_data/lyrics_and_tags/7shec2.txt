Lyrics :
[verse]
There once was a player in the game of life,
Smooth talk on his lips, living with no strife.
Ladies loved him, his charm was gold,
But his secrets were many, his heart was cold.

[chorus]
Playaz ballin', living tall with no falls,
Till the rhythm of truth catches y'all.
The choices you make can lead to dismay,
A lesson learned too late along the way.

[verse]
He danced through danger, never heeded the signs,
Infectious whispers where true love declines.
Love turned lethal, pleasure turned pain,
The reaper's knocking, can't play no more games.

[bridge]
Life ain't a game when it slips through your hands,
Regret's heavy burden, death's reprimands.
AIDS took its toll, now he pays the price,
No rewind button, not rolling the dice.

[chorus]
Playaz ballin', living tall with no falls,
Till the rhythm of truth catches y'all.
The choices you make can lead to dismay,
A story retold in sorrowful relay.
