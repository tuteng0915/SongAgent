Lyrics :
[verse]
Waking up to the sound of chains breaking
Sunlight's streaming through the cracks in the walls
Every heartbeat, every breath I'm taking
Is a step closer to freedom's call

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless

[verse]
Shadows fade as we step into the light
Voices echo through the canyon walls
With every stride, we claim our right
To be free, to answer freedom's call

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless

[bridge]
The weight is gone, we're standing tall
No more limits, no more fall
Together we forge what once was past
Into a future that will forever last

[chorus]
Wub wub, feel the walls come down
Wub wub, hear the freedom sound
We're unstoppable, we'll rise above
In this moment, we are boundless
