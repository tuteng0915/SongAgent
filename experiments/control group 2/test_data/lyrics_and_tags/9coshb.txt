Lyrics :
[verse]
Snapshots in the mirror, who do you see?
Flashlights and filters, trying to be free
In a world of facades, we lose our disguise
Click capture, it's time to realize

[chorus]
We're sending selfies to the world
Broadcasting hearts, unfurling
No more hiding, we're unapologetic
This is us, so take a picture
Snap, snap, click, embrace it
Pop punk style, never gonna fake it

[verse]
Pixelated memories line up the walls
Each one a story, each one a call
To accept the skin that we're living within
Send it out loud, let the real you win

[chorus]
We're sending selfies to the world
Broadcasting hearts, unfurling
No more hiding, we're unapologetic
This is us, so take a picture
Snap, snap, click, embrace it
Pop punk style, never gonna fake it

[bridge]
Every frame a declaration
Of who we are, no preparation
Throw the poses, let's get reckless
Life's a photo, take your best guess

[chorus]
We're sending selfies to the world
Broadcasting hearts, unfurling
No more hiding, we're unapologetic
This is us, so take a picture
Snap, snap, click, embrace it
Pop punk style, never gonna fake it

[ending]
So here's my selfie, itâ€™s the real me
No filter needed, just let it be
Press send, watch it ripple
Through endless streams, we're the ripple
