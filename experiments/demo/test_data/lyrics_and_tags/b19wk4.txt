Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding down the open road
Wind in my hair, I'm feeling bold
Sunset skies painted gold
Every moment's a story untold
Well that's fine by me

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams, catching flights
In this wild ride, everything's right
With a heart full of hope and a spirit so bright
Together we'll dance in the fading light

[bridge]
Through the highs and the lows
On this journey where the wild wind blows
Hand in hand, we'll never let go
In this adventure, we find our home

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams, catching flights
In this wild ride, everything's right
With a heart full of hope and a spirit so bright
Together we'll dance in the fading light

[outro]
So here's to the nights under starlit skies
To the laughter and love that never dies
In this tale of ours, there's no goodbye
Just endless horizons where we can fly
