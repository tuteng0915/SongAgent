Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
In the heart of the city where the lights never fade,
Deli dreams are made in the underground parade.
By day they slice and dice, by night they play so nice,
Underneath the neon glow, beneath the starless sky.

[Chorus]
Oh, we’re the rhythm makers, secret flavor shakers,
In the hidden club, where the beats won’t stop.
With our aprons off, and our dreams in sight,
We dance through the night, till the morning light.

[Bridge]
Ham and rye, but don’t ask why,
The secret’s safe, under the moonlit sky.
Electric strings, make our hearts sing,
In this clandestine cabaret, anything can happen.

[Verse 2 - Female Singer]
Every sandwich tells a story, every note a melody,
Hidden talents in the shadows, where the brave can see.
With a twirl and a spin, she takes the stage tonight,
Her voice a beacon, shining bright, in the dim club light.

[Verse 3 - Twist Ending]
But as the final encore fades, and the crowd begins to cheer,
Red and blue lights flash outside, the mood turns to fear.
The singer steps forward, reveals her badge with pride,
The deli workers' secret club, now under legal guide.
