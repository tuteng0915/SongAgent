Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of my old alarm clock
Pages of my textbook waiting to be unlocked
Backpack on my shoulder, yeah, I'm ready to go
To a place where dreams are born, and we all grow

[chorus]
Oh, these are the days that we won't forget
Chasing our dreams, no regrets
In this classroom, we find our way
Learning lessons every day

[bridge]
Remember scribbling notes in the margins
Laughing 'bout the things we did last weekend
Friends by our side, through thick and thin
This is our time, let the memories begin

[chorus]
Oh, these are the days that we won't forget
Chasing our dreams, no regrets
In this classroom, we find our way
Learning lessons every day

[outro]
So here's to the friends and the times we've had
To the future we dream of, it's not so bad
With a little bit of hope and a lot of fun
We'll keep moving forward, till our journey's done
