Sure thing! Let's start by specifying the genre of the heavy song. Do you prefer metal, hard rock, or something else?
Agent : 
To better tailor the song to your tastes, let's delve a bit deeper into your preferences. Could you specify if you're leaning more towards metal, hard rock, or perhaps another genre entirely? Additionally, is there a specific theme or emotion you'd like the lyrics to convey?
User : 
It's more like hard rock. And the theme... I guess it could be about enduring tough times.

Great, we're going for a hard rock vibe with a theme of enduring tough times. To ensure I capture the essence you're looking for, do you have any specific preferences regarding the structure of the song or particular elements you'd like included in the lyrics? For instance, would you like a part that emphasizes resilience or perhaps a powerful guitar solo to symbolize overcoming challenges?
