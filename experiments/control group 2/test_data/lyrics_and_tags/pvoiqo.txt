Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been thinking 'bout the times we've had
Im sitting on my own here with you

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new

[verse]
Our love is strong, it's all we need
Let's keep moving forward with speed

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new

[bridge]
There's no one else I'd rather be with tonight
Than you, my shining light

[chorus]
We'll make it through, just me and you
Together we can do anything new
