Lyrics :
[verse]
We set out in the midnight glow
With hearts ablaze, ready to go
The world awaits us, vast and wide
Together we'll chase the dreams we hide

[chorus]
Oh, love and adventure, hand in hand
Exploring the unknown across this land
With every step, our spirits rise
Underneath the starlit skies

[verse]
Through winding paths and forest green
Our whispers dance, a secret serene
In every moment, love unfolds
A tale of us, forever told

[chorus]
Oh, love and adventure, hand in hand
Exploring the unknown across this land
With every step, our spirits rise
Underneath the starlit skies

[bridge]
And if the night should call our name
We'll answer loud, never be tamed
For love and adventure guide our way
Turning darkness into day

[chorus]
Oh, love and adventure, hand in hand
Exploring the unknown across this land
With every step, our spirits rise
Underneath the starlit skies
