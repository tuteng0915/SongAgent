Hello, song generating agent! Based on the information provided, I would like you to generate a rock song with the following features:

- The singer should be male, and it would be great if the vocals could emulate a boy-band style.
- In the background, after every three words sung by the lead vocalist, there should be a choir-like "AaAaaAaaAaah" sound.
- The pattern of singing three words (or a word divided into three parts) followed by the choir should be repeated throughout the song.
- The overall style should lean towards rock music.

Please go ahead and create this song for me. Thank you!
