Lyrics :
[verse 1]
In the quiet of a bustling room,
Our eyes met, like stars in bloom.
A moment's pause, the world stood still,
Felt the pull, an unspoken will.

[chorus]
Unexpected, our paths entwined,
A fleeting glance, love redefined.
In the whisper of a crowded space,
Found my heart, in your embrace.

[verse 2]
Through trials and storms, we held on tight,
Learned to dance in the fading light.
With every stumble, we grew stronger,
Our bond deepened, it grew longer.

[chorus]
Unexpected, our paths entwined,
A fleeting glance, love redefined.
In the whisper of a crowded space,
Found my heart, in your embrace.

[bridge]
Years have passed, yet love remains,
In the laughter, and even the pains.
Each wrinkle tells, a story of grace,
A lifetime of love, etched on our face.

[verse 3]
Now in the twilight, of our years,
No more doubts, no more fears.
Together we've walked, through joy and strife,
Hand in hand, through the journey of life.

[chorus]
Unexpected, our paths entwined,
A fleeting glance, love redefined.
In the whisper of a crowded space,
Found my heart, in your embrace.

[outro]
Walking down a sunlit beach,
White dress flowing, memories reach.
The waves whisper tales of old,
Nostalgic scenes, in hues of gold.

[final chorus]
In this serene and timeless place,
I found my heart, in your embrace.
