Lyrics :
[verse]
Faded photographs on the mantle,
Whispers of summers that slipped through our hands.

[chorus]
In the quiet, I hear your laughter,
Echoes of love, long ever after.

[verse]
Old letters penned in the moonlight glow,
Memories of us, more vivid than you know.

[chorus]
In the quiet, I hear your laughter,
Echoes of love, long ever after.

[bridge]
Every sunset holds a story,
Of days when we were wild and free.

[chorus]
In the quiet, I hear your laughter,
Echoes of love, long ever after.
