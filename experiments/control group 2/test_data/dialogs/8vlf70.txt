Hey song agent! I need your help generating a song based on some details I have in mind. Here's what I'm thinking:

- The singer could be male, but it’s not strictly necessary.
- Modern/electronic style with a fast, dancey tempo.
- Very bass-heavy with an occasional high-pitched sound effect—like a tropical bird call or something similar made up of four distinct notes.
- The chorus should repeat the phrase "She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say."

Can you create something like that for me?

```
[verse]
In the night, lights are bright, moving to the rhythm of the beat
Feel the bass, it's a test, lose yourself within the heat

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say

[verse]
Underneath the neon glow, shadows dance, they come and go
Echoes of a bird's song, four notes ringing, can't go wrong

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say

[bridge]
The world spins, time begins, caught within the music's grasp
Lose control, let it roll, feel the pressure as it laps

[chorus]
She can say she can say (x3) yeah that's what she's gonna say
```
