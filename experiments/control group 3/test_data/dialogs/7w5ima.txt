Sure, let's go for it! I want a powerful metal/rock song with clean vocals and an emotionally charged chorus. Can you start working on that?

Sure thing! To make sure I get this right, could you specify any particular themes or messages you'd like the lyrics to convey? Also, do you have a preference for the song's tempo or any specific instruments you'd like to feature?
User : 
The theme should be about desperation and longing, with a chorus that feels like "Rescue me... I'm drowning." Make it intense and emotional. The tempo and instruments are irrelevant as long as it sounds heavy and melodic.

I've crafted a set of lyrics and tags that should match your vision for a powerful metal/rock song with an emotionally charged chorus. Here's what I came up with:

**Tags:** metal, rock, clean vocals, emotional, powerful, heavy, melodic

**Lyrics:**
```
[verse]
In the shadows I've been hiding,
Lost in the echoes of my mind.
Every step feels like I'm sliding,
Down this endless spiral of time.

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning in despair,
Lift me up from depths of pain.
I'm reaching out for someone to care,
Save me now, before I go insane.

[verse]
Shadows grow as hope is fading,
Silent screams are all that remain.
In this abyss where fear's invading,
Will I ever see the light again?

[chorus]
Rescue me, I'm drowning in despair,
Lift me up from depths of pain.
I'm reaching out for someone to care,
Save me now, before I go insane.

[bridge]
With every heartbeat, feel the power,
Rising from the ashes of decay.
In this moment, find a new hour,
Break these chains, and fly away.
