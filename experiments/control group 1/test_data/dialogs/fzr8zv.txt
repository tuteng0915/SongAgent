[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets
Where shadows dance and memories meet
Every step feels like a heavy stone
In this world that I've come to know

[chorus]
Tears fall like rain from the sky
Wishing on stars that dreams could fly
But they fade away as night turns to day
Leaving me lost in yesterday

[verse]
Silent whispers fill the air
Of love once cherished, now nowhere
Time moves on, but I'm standing still
Haunted by echoes of what we had

[chorus]
Tears fall like rain from the sky
Wishing on stars that dreams could fly
But they fade away as night turns to day
Leaving me lost in yesterday

[bridge]
I remember your smile, so bittersweet
A gentle touch that made my heart skip a beat
Now all that's left is a hollow space
Longing for moments I can't replace

[chorus]
Tears fall like rain from the sky
Wishing on stars that dreams could fly
But they fade away as night turns to day
Leaving me lost in yesterday
