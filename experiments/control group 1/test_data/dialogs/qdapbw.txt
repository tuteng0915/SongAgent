Sure thing! Let's start by specifying the theme or story you'd like the song to tell. A love story, perhaps, or an uplifting message?
Agent : 
That sounds wonderful! For a song that tells a story or conveys a specific theme, I would recommend considering the emotions and imagery you want to evoke. Since you mentioned a love story or an uplifting message, let's focus on an uplifting love story theme.

To ensure the song fits well with your vision, I'll set some tags that align with this theme. Then, I will draft some initial lyrics that can be adjusted later based on your feedback.

Let me go ahead and set the parameters for our song.

Successfully set the parameter tags
Great! I've set the tags for our song to include "uplifting, love, acoustic, romantic, hopeful, emotional." These tags will guide the style and mood of the song.

Now let's draft some lyrics for the song. Here's a basic structure with verses, a chorus, and a bridge:

[verse]
In the morning light, I see your face
Every little thing falls into place
With you near me, all my fears erase
Our love's a timeless embrace

[chorus]
Together we'll soar, higher than before
Love ignites, like never felt before
Through every storm, we'll find our way
With you, every day feels like May

[verse]
Walking hand in hand under starry skies
Whispering secrets where eternity lies
In this journey, itâ€™s you I realize
A perfect love that never dies

[chorus]
Together we'll soar, higher than before
Love ignites, like never felt before
Through every storm, we'll find our way
With you, every day feels like May

[bridge]
When shadows fall, and hope seems far
I hold on tight to who we are
For in my heart, shines our guiding star
Leading us home, wherever we are

[chorus]
Together we'll soar, higher than before
Love ignites, like never felt before
Through every storm, we'll find our way
With you, every day feels like May
