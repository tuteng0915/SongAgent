Hey there, song agent! I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of TLC or Salt n' Pepa's style. The lyrics should tell a story about a guy who's a real player, smooth-talking his way through life. However, the twist is that his reckless lifestyle catches up with him, leading to a tragic end due to something like AIDS. Itâ€™s meant to be a cautionary tale wrapped in a catchy, 90s hip-hop vibe. Can you help me create something with this concept?
