Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the night, we rise
Feel the thunder, hear the cries
Electric dreams in neon lights
A symphony of heartbeats ignites

[chorus]
Do you feel it, too? (Do you feel it, too?)
The beat that's calling me and you (and you)
We'll dance beneath the stars so true (so true)
With every step, our spirits renew

[verse]
Caught within a web of sound
Where echoes linger all around
Voices blend, they intertwine
In this moment, we're divine

[chorus]
Do you feel it, too? (Do you feel it, too?)
The rhythm pulling me to you (to you)
Together we will chase the moon (the moon)
And paint the sky with hues anew

[bridge]
As we climb higher, voices soar
The music lifts us off the floor
Electric currents through us flow
Our hearts are beating fast, I know

[key-change][chorus]
Does it move your soul? (Does it move your soul?)
Are we finally where we're whole? (we're whole)
Let the harmony ensue (ensue)
In this anthem made for two
