I’d like you to create a French pop song with a male and female vocalist trading lines, harmonizing on the chorus, and using "if" followed by rhyming words like "exclusif" and "négatif." The tempo should be medium-slow, reflective, and the title should be one word. Can you do that?

I have set up the song according to your preferences. The song is titled "Différent" and it's a reflective French pop piece with a male and female vocalist trading lines and harmonizing on the chorus, incorporating rhyming words like "exclusif" and "négatif." 

Here's how the lyrics are structured:

- **[verse 1 - male]** introduces a longing for inclusiveness.
- **[verse 2 - female]** continues with imagery of dancing with shadows.
- **[chorus - both]** wonders what could be if things were different, more elusive.
- **[verse 3 - male]** expresses feelings about the silence between two people.
- **[verse 4 - female]** contemplates under the complicit midnight sky.
- **[chorus - both]** repeats the hopeful wondering of change.
- **[bridge - both]** considers the possibilities that tomorrow may bring.
- **[chorus - both]** once again ponders the potential for change.
- **[outro - both]** ends with lingering thoughts.
