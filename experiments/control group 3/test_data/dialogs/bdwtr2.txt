I need to create a song with breaks in the chorus and includes a "woo, hoo. Wah hoo" chant. The lyrics should be fast, and it needs a segment reminiscent of "duttily duttly dah." Let's see if I can get more details on how you'd like these elements incorporated.

Could you specify the genre or any particular theme you'd like this song to follow?
Agent : 
Sure, to better tailor the song to your vision, could you also share if you're leaning towards a specific genre or theme? For instance, are we aiming for something more energetic like pop or perhaps something with a rock edge? Additionally, do you have any particular imagery or emotion you'd like the lyrics to evoke?

Let's go with an energetic pop vibe. I think that would fit well with the fast lyrics and fun elements we're adding. And for the theme, maybe something related to a wild, carefree night out? What do you think about that direction?

That sounds like a fantastic direction! An energetic pop vibe with a theme centered around a wild, carefree night out will definitely be catchy and fun. I'll start drafting some lyrics that incorporate your ideas, including the breaks in the chorus, the "woo, hoo. Wah hoo" chant, and the "duttily duttly dah" segment.

Let's proceed to set the tags and draft the initial lyrics.

  [verse]
  Racing through the neon glow,
  City lights, where we lose control.
  Heartbeats sync with every step,
  In this moment, we forget.

  [chorus]
  Break it down now (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
  Dancing under moonlit skies,
  Feel alive in the rhythm of the night (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)

  [verse]
  Shadows dance as stars align,
  Freedom calls in the midnight shine.

  [bridge]
  duttily duttly dah, let the music take you there,
  duttily duttly dah, nothing else compares.

  [chorus]
  Break it down now (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
  Dancing under moonlit skies,
  Feel alive in the rhythm of the night (woo, hoo. Wah hoo)
