Lyrics :
[verse]
I feel the rhythm in my soul
Dancing through the night, losing control

[chorus]
Oh, this love is like a dream
Underneath the starlit sky, we gleam

[verse]
In this moment, time stands still
With your love, I've found my thrill

[bridge]
Together we'll fly, higher and higher
Our hearts set to the rhythm of the fire

[chorus]
Oh, this love is like a dream
Underneath the starlit sky, we gleam
