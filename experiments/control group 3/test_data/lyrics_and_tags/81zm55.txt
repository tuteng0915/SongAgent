Lyrics :
[verse]
Riding through the night, with the stars above
Feel the rhythm take control, it's the power of love

[chorus]
Yeahh, guitar screaming loud, like a rebel's call
Yeahh, together we'll ignite, the fire in us all
Yeahh, feel the beat, let it lift you high
Yeahh, in this moment, we touch the sky

[verse]
On this endless highway, there's nothing to hold us down
With every beat, feel the freedom surround

[chorus]
Yeahh, guitar screaming loud, like a rebel's call
Yeahh, together we'll ignite, the fire in us all
Yeahh, feel the beat, let it lift you high
Yeahh, in this moment, we touch the sky

[bridge]
It’s not just music, it’s the essence of life
In every note, find your strength, cut like a knife

[chorus]
Yeahh, guitar screaming loud, like a rebel's call
Yeahh, together we'll ignite, the fire in us all
Yeahh, feel the beat, let it lift you high
Yeahh, in this moment, we touch the sky
