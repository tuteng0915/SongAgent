Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the night, feeling so alive
Heartbeat in my chest, ready to survive
City lights are shining, they light up my way
Every step I take is a brand new day

[chorus]
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow

[verse]
Underneath the stars, where dreams come to play
Let the music guide us, we'll never fade away
Feel the bassline pumping, it's taking control
We'll keep moving forward, let it feed our soul

[chorus]
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow

[bridge]
Tonight we own the city, our shadows cast
With every heartbeat, memories amass
In this moment forever, we'll stay
Lost within the magic, till the break of day

[chorus]
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow
