Hey, song generating agent! I need your help creating a song based on a music video concept that’s been stuck in my head. Here’s the idea:

The song should feel like an upbeat pop track with a catchy rhythm, something that could have come out around 2014 or 2015. It opens with a scene of a kid riding his skateboard, then transitions to a vibrant laundromat filled with quirky characters—a lady carrying a birdcage, some guys with glitter and braids, and more. There’s also this girl who’s clearly frustrated with her boyfriend; she slaps his phone out of his hand to get his attention.

Then, the skateboard kid enters, starts doing laundry, and suddenly becomes the center of attention when the rude girl begins flirting/dancing with him. Meanwhile, at the front of the laundromat stands the band (the lead singer has curly hair), almost like they’re guarding the room as everyone starts dancing wildly. At the end, the kid and the rude girl sneak out together while the party continues behind them.

Can you generate a song that fits this vibe? Something fun, flirty, and full of energy—perfect for a chaotic yet joyful laundromat dance party! Let me know what you come up with!

**Tags:** upbeat, pop, catchy, 2014-2015, fun, flirty, energetic, vibrant, dance, retro, youthful

**Lyrics:**
```
[verse]
Skateboard wheels roll down the street
A kid with a dream and two bare feet
Laundromat lights, they flicker and glow
Quirky faces putting on a show

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[verse]
There's a girl with fire in her eyes
Her boyfriend's phone meets an early demise
But then she sees him, the skateboarding star
Suddenly he's stealing her heart

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[bridge]
The band plays on as the front-line guard
Curly hair swaying, setting the standard
Wild moves flying, clothes spinning round
In this chaotic party town

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[outro]
As the night fades to a memory bright
The kid and the girl sneak out under moonlight
Laundry forgotten, but who really cares?
The rhythm stays with us unawares
