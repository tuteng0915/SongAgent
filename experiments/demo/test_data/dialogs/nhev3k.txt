I need a song that's popular and gets people dancing, with an EDM feel. Can you make something like that?

Sure, I can create an upbeat EDM song that's popular and dance-worthy. To get started, could you tell me what kind of lyrics or theme you'd like for the song? For example, is there a particular message or emotion you want to convey? If not, I'll go ahead with a generic party vibe.

How about a theme of love and unity, something that brings people together on the dance floor?

I've crafted a song with the theme of love and unity, perfect for bringing people together on the dance floor. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Feel the beat, it's our time to shine
Together we're stronger, hearts intertwined
Underneath electric skies, we unite
Love's the rhythm that makes us ignite

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity

[verse]
Electric pulses, moving you and me
A symphony of souls in harmony
In this space, where dreams are realized
Our spirits soaring, riding on the tide

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity

[bridge]
Through the night, till the morning light
Every heartbeat joins in the fight
For a world where love conquers all
Together we rise, never gonna fall

[chorus]
Dance as one, feel the love flow free
In this moment, we’re breaking boundaries
With every step, we create history
On this dance floor, pure unity

The lyrics are great, but can we add a part where a female voice says "dance dance dance" before the beat drops? And make sure it continues faintly in the background after the drop.

I've updated the lyrics to include a female voice saying "dance dance dance" before the beat drops, and ensured it continues faintly in the background after the drop. Here's the revised section:

[pre-drop]
Female voice: Dance dance dance

[drop]
Background faintly continues: Dance dance dance

Now, please press the "generate" button again to create the updated version of the song.

I've made the adjustments you requested. The song now includes a female voice saying "dance dance dance" right before the beat drops, and it continues faintly in the background afterward. I believe this meets all your requirements. 

The song is now complete and ready for you!
