Lyrics :
[intro]
Synthesizer riff

[verse 1]
Long days and black nights,
I'm waiting for your call,
Every moment feels so still,
Without you, I'm nothing at all.

[chorus]
Oh, these doo-wop nights,
Are lonely without your sound,
In this voicemail serenade,
My heart's message will be found.

[verse 2]
The stars are dim, the moon won't shine,
I dial your number, it's a matter of time,
Your voice is the melody in my head,
A love song that never said.

[chorus]
Oh, these doo-wop nights,
Are lonely without your sound,
In this voicemail serenade,
My heart's message will be found.

[bridge - voicemail interlude]
Hey, it's me againâ€¦ just calling to hear your voice. These days feel so long, and the nights even longer. Call me back when you can. I miss you.

[chorus]
Oh, these doo-wop nights,
Are lonely without your sound,
In this voicemail serenade,
My heart's message will be found.

[outro]
Piano fades out...
