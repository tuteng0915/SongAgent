Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits the following description: The song should have a rock vibe with a dubstep-inspired guitar effect in the chorus, particularly a "wub wub" sound, though it shouldn’t fully lean into being a dubstep track. It should feel like it could’ve been released around 2012 when dubstep was fading but still influential. The rhythm of the guitar should follow a syncopated pattern like: 1 a + 3 a + 1, giving it a faux-triplet feel. The lyrics and energy should evoke the feeling of breaking free or liberation, as if the walls are metaphorically (or literally) coming down during the chorus. The overall tone should be radio-friendly, catchy, and fit well on rock radio stations from that era. Let’s create something that captures this vibe!
