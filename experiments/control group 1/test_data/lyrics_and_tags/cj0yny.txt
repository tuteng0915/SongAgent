Lyrics :
[verse]
By the still lake, whispers blend,
With the soft rustle of reeds in the wind.
Ripples dance on the moonlit face,
Of this tranquil, mirrored space.

[chorus]
Flowing gently, time slows down,
In the heart of the night, peace is found.
Waves of calm lap at my soul,
In this quietude, I am whole.

[verse]
Underneath stars, the river winds,
Through valleys deep and forest pines.
A silver path, so cool and clear,
Guides me home, year after year.

[chorus]
Flowing gently, time slows down,
In the heart of the night, peace is found.
Waves of calm lap at my soul,
In this quietude, I am whole.

[bridge]
As dawn approaches, light begins,
To shimmer on the water's skin.
Each moment precious, stillness stays,
In the warmth of new beginnings.
