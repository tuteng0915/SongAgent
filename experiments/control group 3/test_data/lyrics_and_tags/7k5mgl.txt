Lyrics :
[verse]
He's the guy with the heart of gold
But his love life’s a story untold
Every time he tries, it goes wrong
But he keeps on singing his song

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
She said let's just be friends
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true

[verse]
Underneath the neon lights
He dances alone every night
Searching for a sign or clue
That his heart will find something new

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
She said let's just be friends
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true

[bridge]
The world keeps spinning round and round
But he won’t let it get him down
With a smile and a hopeful view
He knows his dreams will come true

[chorus]
Oh, he's got that bad luck in love
Can't find a girl to rise above
She said let's just be friends
With every step, he stumbles through
Hoping one day he'll find someone true
