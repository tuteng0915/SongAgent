I want a song that's a mix of R&B, pop, and has that groovy psychedelic soul vibe. Think late 60s to early 70s dance party. Can we start with that?

Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I get it right, could you tell me more about the specific elements or moods you'd like in the song? For example, do you have any preferences for the tempo, key, or any particular instruments that should be featured? Also, are there any themes or messages you'd like the lyrics to convey?
User : 
Let's keep it upbeat and catchy, something that gets people moving. The male singer should have a deep voice, and we need some female backup singers too. Can you work with that?

Great! I've set the tags for your song to capture that upbeat, catchy R&B and pop vibe with a groovy, psychedelic soul feel reminiscent of a late 60s to early 70s dance party. We'll also make sure to feature a male singer with a deep voice and include some female backup singers.

Now, let's draft the lyrics. Since you want something lively and engaging, how about we create a fun love story or an invitation to dance? Could you provide any specific ideas or lines you'd like included in the lyrics?

I've drafted some lyrics for your song that aim to capture the lively and engaging atmosphere you're looking for. Here's a preview:

[verse]
There she goes, moving to the beat
In a world where love and music meet
With every step, she casts a spell
A dance floor queen, she knows it well

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down

[verse]
He's got a voice like a midnight dream
Singing songs of love, making hearts team
With every note, he lights up the room
And those backup voices, they bring the boom

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down

[bridge]
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme
Let's keep dancing till the end of time
In this moment, we're alive
Together we'll thrive, let's take a dive

[chorus]
Come on, come on, let's get together
Dance under the stars, feel the weather
Psychedelic vibes, colors all around
Let's keep this party going till the sun goes down

The lyrics are nice, but I'd like the main line to be "can you dig it baby." Can we change that? And make sure the male vocals shine with a bit of Marvin Sease's flair.
