Lyrics :
[verse]
Sunshine on my face, I'm feeling alive
Every single moment, I'm ready to dive
Into a world of colors, where dreams come true
With every breath I take, I'm thinking of you

[chorus]
We'll dance under the stars, laugh until we cry
Feel the rhythm of the night, let our spirits fly
Together we're unstoppable, our hearts aligned
In this perfect moment, life is so kind

[verse]
Walking hand in hand, we conquer it all
Big dreams in our eyes, nothing can stall
Our journey to greatness, as we turn the page
The soundtrack of our lives, playing at full stage

[chorus]
We'll dance under the stars, laugh until we cry
Feel the rhythm of the night, let our spirits fly
Together we're unstoppable, our hearts aligned
In this perfect moment, life is so kind

[bridge]
Oh oh oh, let's keep the fire burning
Shrug it off when the times get tough
Pointing down where the rhythm's at
Feet moving free, yeah that's enough

[verse]
Through the storms and rains, we stand tall and proud
Challenges may come, but we laugh out loud
With faith in our hearts, we choose to be glad
For every twist and turn makes us feel more clad

[chorus]
We'll dance under the stars, laugh until we cry
Feel the rhythm of the night, let our spirits fly
Together we're unstoppable, our hearts aligned
In this perfect moment, life is so kind

[verse]
Step by step, we move through the day
Whether it's work or just walking away
Dancing through the city, our spirits high
Living for the moment, beneath the sky

[chorus]
We'll dance under the stars, laugh until we cry
Feel the rhythm of the night, let our spirits fly
Together we're unstoppable, our hearts aligned
In this perfect moment, life is so kind
