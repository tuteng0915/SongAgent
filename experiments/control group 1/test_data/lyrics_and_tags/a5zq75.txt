Lyrics :
[verse]
In the haze of a dream I find you again
A silhouette against the moon's soft glow
Our words like echoes bounce and then fade
In this dreamscape where we used to go

[chorus]
I'm chasing shadows in a world so vast
Lost in the maze of our tangled past
But even in dreams, love finds its way
Through the darkness, into the light of day

[verse]
Each night I wander through this endless night
Hoping to touch what's just beyond reach
The stars above whisper your name
In this surreal journey, nothing seems real

[chorus]
I'm chasing shadows in a world so vast
Lost in the maze of our tangled past
But even in dreams, love finds its way
Through the darkness, into the light of day

[bridge]
We fight, we fall, yet here we stand
Bound by threads invisible and grand
Our hearts entwined in a fragile dance
A fleeting moment, a second chance

[chorus]
I'm chasing shadows in a world so vast
Lost in the maze of our tangled past
But even in dreams, love finds its way
Through the darkness, into the light of day

[outro]
As dawn breaks, the dream begins to fray
Yet in my heart, your memory will stay
