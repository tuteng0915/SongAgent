Hey there! I want to generate a song that has these breaks in between the chorus with someone going "woo, hoo. Wah hoo". The lyrics are really fast, and it would be great if it could include a part similar to the "duttily duttly dah" segment from the Krusty Krab training video that went viral as a Vine. Hope you can help me create something like this!
