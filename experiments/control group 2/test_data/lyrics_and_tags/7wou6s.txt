Lyrics :
[verse]
I walked into the bar, lights were dim and low,
A saxophone was playing soft, in this place I know.
The bartender he winked, as he slid me a glass,
It's a dirty old martini, time just seemed to pass.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.

[verse]
She sat at the end of the bar, her eyes locked on mine,
With a smile so wicked, like a secret sign.
We talked about old stories, we laughed until dawn,
And I knew right then, she was the one to spawn.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.

[bridge]
Oh those nights, they roll and sway,
In the haze of smoke and music play.
Where every drink, tells a tale,
Of romance and adventures that never pale.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong, with a dirty old martini,
In the world of neon shadows, where the nights are plenty.
You can never go wrong, with a sip so fine,
In the heart of the city, under neon signs.
