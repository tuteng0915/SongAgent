Lyrics :
[Verse]
Walking through the halls, painted gray and cold,
Stories of the brave, whispers never told.
Pages of a book, each one a different face,
In this crowded room, I'm still feeling out of place.

[Chorus]
We're the dreamers, reaching for the sky,
Falling down but we don’t ever die.
In this messed-up world, we’ll find our way,
With hearts ablaze, we'll make them pay.

[Bridge]
Hold on tight to what you believe,
Even when they try to make you leave.
Your voice is strong, let it echo loud,
In the silence, stand unbowed.
