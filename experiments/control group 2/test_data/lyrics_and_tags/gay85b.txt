Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadowed streets where whispers echo,
the clock ticks down to the final show.
The skyline's changed, no longer a view,
in this city of ours, painted in hues of blue.

[chorus]
The kids don't go to school, there's simply nothing left to learn,
They spend their days embracing every moment, taking turns.
Beneath the starlit sky, we dance amidst the gloom,
with a year to live, our hearts rewrite our doom.

[verse]
Families gather round as stories intertwine,
every smile and tear a testament to time.
Buildings stand like ghosts, memories held tight,
we find beauty in decay, in the fading light.

[chorus]
The kids don't go to school, there's simply nothing left to learn,
They teach each other now, it's life's final turn.
Amongst the rubble, we've found our song,
a symphony of souls, together we belong.

[bridge]
One year remains, yet love will never fade,
in this doomed city, our spirits serenade.
Hand in hand we face what's coming,
our legacy eternal, forever drumming.

[chorus]
The kids don't go to school, for textbooks hold no cure,
They chase the sunrise, while skies assure.
Though our city falls, its soul will still return,
in every heart that loved beneath its spire, we burn.
