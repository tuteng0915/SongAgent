Lyrics :
[verse]
Shadows fall where silence reigns
Whispers echo through the plains
A spectral dance in moonlit glow
Secrets linger, none will know

[chorus]
Haunting beauty fills the air
Drones of sorrow, beyond compare
Ethereal dreams in shadows cast
Bound by night, forever vast

[verse]
Voices call from realms unknown
In twilight's grasp, they've overgrown
The echoes weave a mournful tune
Beneath the watchful, pale-lit moon

[chorus]
Haunting beauty fills the air
Drones of sorrow, beyond compare
Ethereal dreams in shadows cast
Bound by night, forever vast

[bridge]
In liminal spaces, we dwell
Where heaven and earth entwine and swell
An endless night, a timeless tale
Of spectral wonders, frail and pale
