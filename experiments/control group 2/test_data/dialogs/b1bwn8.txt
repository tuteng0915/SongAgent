Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I want to generate a somber and soulful song with deep, dark undertones, sung by a female vocalist. The lyrics should evoke imagery related to falling into a river or being submerged in water, with an emotional intensity that matches the visuals of someone creating velvet art while listening. It should have a slow tempo and feature rich instrumentation—think haunting melodies, maybe some piano or strings—to give it weight and depth. Additionally, this song could fit alongside tracks like "Fly Like a Bird," so consider incorporating elements of alternative rock or soft ballads from the late '90s or early 2000s. Can you create something based on these details?

**Lyrics:**

[verse]  
In the depths where shadows quiver,  
I felt the pull of the river.  
Velvet whispers in hues untold,  
A canvas drowned in shades of old.  

[chorus]  
Falling down, lost in blue,  
Where the cold waters pull me through.  
Echoes call from caverns deep,  
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.  

[verse]  
Strings like tears on a ghostly breeze,  
Piano sighs amidst the trees.  
Each note a ripple, each chord a wave,  
In this somber tune, my heart's enslaved.  

[chorus]  
Falling down, lost in blue,  
Where the cold waters pull me through.  
Echoes call from caverns deep,  
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.  

[bridge]  
Beneath the surface, time stands still,  
A mournful hymn, a velvet will.  
Creation born from sorrow's grasp,  
Beauty and pain in every clasp.  

[chorus]  
Falling down, lost in blue,  
Where the cold waters pull me through.  
Echoes call from caverns deep,  
In this abyss, my secrets sleep.
