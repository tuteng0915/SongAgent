Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the main theme or message of the song. What do you want the song to convey?
Agent : 
Great! To better understand your preferences, could you please tell me what kind of themes or messages you'd like the song to convey? For example, it could be about love, adventure, personal growth, or any other topic that resonates with you. Additionally, do you have any specific style or genre in mind for this song?
User : 
It should be about having fun and enjoying life, maybe with a hint of nostalgia. The genre could be pop with elements of indie rock. That's all for now.

I've set the theme and lyrics for your song based on your preferences. The tags include "fun," "life," "enjoyment," "nostalgia," "pop," and "indie rock." Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Woke up to the sound of the radio
Sunshine on my face, feeling so mellow
Grabbed my shades and hit the road
No place I'd rather be, no place I'd go

[chorus]
We're living life like it's golden
Dancing under neon lights
With old friends and new beginnings
Every moment feels so right

[verse]
Riding bikes down by the shoreline
Laughter in the air, everything's fine
Memories we'll keep, like photographs
In the album of our lives, forever they'll last

[bridge]
Oh, these are the days we'll remember
When we're old and grey, sitting by the fire
Stories we'll tell, of wild nights and dreams
Of chasing stars and teenage schemes

[chorus]
We're living life like it's golden
Dancing under neon lights
With old friends and new beginnings
Every moment feels so right

The lyrics are nice, but I was hoping for something more upbeat and with group singing. Can we adjust that?

I've updated the tags to include "upbeat" and "group singing" to better match your preferences. Now, please press the "generate" button again to create a new version of the song that reflects these changes.

Let's give it another go. Generate the song again, please.

Sure thing! Please press the "generate" button to create the updated version of the song with a more upbeat tempo and group singing elements. If you need any further adjustments, feel free to let me know!

Alright, I think we've got it this time. The song should now be more upbeat with group singing elements. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to tweak or if you're happy with the result!
