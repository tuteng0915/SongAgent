Lyrics :
[verse]
Woooooooow girl something in your eyes
Something I recognize
Trouble with me now

[chorus]
Harmonica sings a song so sweet and low
A mirror to my soul
In this moment, we're whole

[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets at night
Underneath the neon lights
Searching for a sign

[bridge]
The world spins on without a care
But I'm lost in thoughts of you everywhere

[chorus]
Harmonica sings a song so sweet and low
A mirror to my soul
In this moment, we're whole

[ending]
Have you ever seen such an empty room
Echoes of our past, like ghosts in gloom
