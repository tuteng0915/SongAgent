Hey, song generating agent! I need a song that starts with funky rock vibes and has this quirky intro where the singer laughs like "ha ha, ha ha, mmhmm, mmhmm." Can you do that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create a song with a funky rock vibe and a quirky intro as you described. Let's set the tags to match the funky rock style and write the lyrics with the specified laugh in the intro. 

I'll go ahead and set these parameters for you.

The tags for your song are "funky, rock, quirky, upbeat," and the lyrics have a structure with an intro of laughter. However, we still need to flesh out the verses and chorus. 

For the verse, could you tell me more about the nonsensical or absurd story you'd like the singer to tell in a fast-paced speaking style?
Agent : 
Great, we have the framework and style in place. Now let's focus on the content for the verses and chorus. Since you want a fast-paced speaking style with an absurd or nonsensical story, could you provide some key elements or themes you'd like included in the story? For example, should it involve characters, settings, or specific scenarios that contribute to the quirky nature of the song? This will help me craft lyrics that match your vision.
User : 
Let's have a story about a dancing elephant in a tutu who becomes a rock star. Keep it wild and wacky!
Agent : 
That sounds like a wildly wacky story indeed! An elephant in a tutu turning into a rock star is just the kind of quirky narrative that fits our song. Let me draft some lyrics for the verses and chorus based on this whimsical tale.

I'll go ahead and set the lyrics with the story you've suggested.

[verse 1]
There once was an elephant who loved to dance,
In a tutu so bright, he had his chance,
At the jungle fest, he made his stand,
With a wiggle and a wag, he rocked the land.

[chorus]
Rockin' elephant, tutu clad,
Shaking tail, looking rad,
Trumpet solo, oh what a show,
Dancing through the jungle, stealing the glow.

[verse 2]
He stomped and he twirled under neon skies,
With every spin, the crowd's surprise,
Guitar riffs echoed his mighty name,
Elvis the elephant, no one's the same.

[chorus]
Rockin' elephant, tutu clad,
Shaking tail, looking rad,
Trumpet solo, oh what a show,
Dancing through the jungle, stealing the glow.
The lyrics are now complete with our dancing elephant, Elvis, in his tutu, rocking out in the jungle. The chorus is catchy and fun, capturing the whimsical rise to fame of our unexpected rock star.

What do you think about adding a confrontational edge in the second verse or perhaps an additional bridge section where we question someone's beliefs or actions, like “Do you think it’s that easy?” and “Do you really think it’s true?”
Agent : 
That's an interesting twist to add a confrontational edge or a questioning bridge. Let's incorporate that into the song while keeping the whimsical theme intact.

I'll add a bridge section after the second verse with some thought-provoking questions, still maintaining the quirky and upbeat style of the song.

Let me update the lyrics for you.

Do you think it’s that easy, to be a star?
Do you really think it’s true, that fame's not far?
Look at Elvis, dancing free,
Who would've thought, wild as can be!
