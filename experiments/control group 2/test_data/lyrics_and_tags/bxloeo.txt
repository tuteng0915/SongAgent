Lyrics :
[verse]
In a world of monochrome, where shadows play,
The band gathers under the mirror's ray.
A disco beat with a soldier's stance,
We climb aboard for this mirrored dance.

[chorus]
Oh, the rhythm takes us high,
Underneath the starless sky.
With reflections leading our way,
In a truck we dance and sway.

[verse]
Military truck with its engine's roar,
Carries us onward, forevermore.
Each note a step, each chord a sign,
In this strange parade, we intertwine.

[bridge]
Through the night, we chase the groove,
With a mirrored head, there's so much to prove.
Disco lights in a camo scene,
Our music unites where visions convene.

[chorus]
Oh, the rhythm takes us high,
Underneath the starless sky.
With reflections leading our way,
In a truck we dance and sway.
