Hey there! Iâ€™d like you to generate a song that captures the essence of an "end of an 80's coming of age" vibe. The lyrics should include the line "and the seasons chaaahange!" and it should have a blend of styles as if Elvis were singing an epic Morrissey song. Can you create something with that feel?
