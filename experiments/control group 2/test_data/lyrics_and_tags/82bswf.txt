Lyrics :
[verse]
In a house where dreams come alive
The air is buzzing, feel so alive
With colors dancing on the walls
And echoes of laughter in these halls

[chorus]
Oh, we’re shining bright like the morning sun
In this magical place where the fun's begun
With every corner that we turn
There’s something new for us to learn

[verse]
Surrounded by creatures wild and free
Multicolored magic as far as we see
Together we wander, together we play
In this wonderland until the break of day

[chorus]
Oh, we’re shining bright like the morning sun
In this magical place where the fun's begun
With every corner that we turn
There’s something new for us to learn

[bridge]
A symphony of sounds fills the night
Underneath the stars so vividly bright
Every moment feels just like a dream
In this enchanted house, nothing’s as it seems

[chorus]
Oh, we’re shining bright like the morning sun
In this magical place where the fun's begun
With every corner that we turn
There’s something new for us to learn
