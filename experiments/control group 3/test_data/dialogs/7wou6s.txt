I want a song with an 80s vibe, featuring a deep, smokey male voice. The theme should revolve around how you can never go wrong with a certain drink, and it should include stories of picking up girls. The chorus should convey the idea that you can never go wrong with a specific drink, like a dirty old martini. Let's aim for a fun, retro track. Could you work on that?

Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular stories or scenarios you'd like included in the song? Also, is there a specific drink you'd like to be the focus of the chorus, or should I go with the dirty old martini idea? Lastly, are there any specific tags or vibes beyond the 80s feel that you want to be incorporated into the song?

Let's go with the dirty old martini for the chorus. For stories, something about meeting someone special at a bar would be great. As for tags, let's keep it simple and just focus on the 80s vibe.
