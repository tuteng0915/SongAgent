Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that matches some specific details. Here's what I have in mind:

- It should be an upbeat pop song, created around 3-4 years ago.
- The artist is likely an African American male.
- The theme of the song revolves around bad things happening but maintaining happiness regardless.
- There might be references to going to work or walking down the street.
- The song should also inspire a dance where someone puts their hands up like "I don't know" during one verse and points at their feet during another part of the chorus.

Can you help me generate a song that fits these criteria?

    Walking down the street, yeah, you know the vibe
    Hands up in the air, like I don't know why
    Bad things happen but I keep my head high
    Gotta keep moving, ain't no time to cry

  - **[chorus]**
    Put your hands up, like you don't know
    Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
    Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
    In the midst of chaos, watch us grow

  - **[verse]**
    Everyday hustle, going to my job
    Thinking 'bout the dreams that I want to unlock
    Got the world on my shoulders, but I rock
    With a smile on my face, 'cause this is my block

  - **[chorus]**
    Put your hands up, like you don't know
    Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
    Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
    In the midst of chaos, watch us grow

  - **[bridge]**
    We rise, we fall, but we never break
    Dancing through the storm, no time for hate
    Together we stand, with love as our stake
    In this journey of life, let the music take

  - **[chorus]**
    Put your hands up, like you don't know
    Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
    Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
    In the midst of chaos, watch us grow
