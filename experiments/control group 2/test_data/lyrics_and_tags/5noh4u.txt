Lyrics :
[verse]
baby I love you
I really love you
[chorus]
all my life
I've been waiting for you
stay
stay
[bridge]
every night and every day
you take all my worries away
[chorus]
all my life
I've been waiting for you
stay
stay
[chorus]
all my life
I've been searching for love
and now that I've found you
I'll never let go
stay
stay
stay
