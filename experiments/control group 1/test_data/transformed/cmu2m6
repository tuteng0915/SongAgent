Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on a scenario I have in mind. The song should be happy and funny, not serious at all. It’s about a man who discovers his girlfriend cheating on him with his neighbor or friend. In response, he goes out to the garden in his bathrobe, starts watering his flowers, and then hilariously destroys parts of his house or specific rooms. This song should feel like it could’ve been released between 2000 and 2005. Can you create something that fits this description?
