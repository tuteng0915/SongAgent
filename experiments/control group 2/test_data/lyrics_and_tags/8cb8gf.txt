Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the street, yeah, you know the vibe
Hands up in the air, like I don't know why
Bad things happen but I keep my head high
Gotta keep moving, ain't no time to cry

[chorus]
Put your hands up, like you don't know
Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
In the midst of chaos, watch us grow

[verse]
Everyday hustle, going to my job
Thinking 'bout the dreams that I want to unlock
Got the world on my shoulders, but I rock
With a smile on my face, 'cause this is my block

[chorus]
Put your hands up, like you don't know
Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
In the midst of chaos, watch us grow

[bridge]
We rise, we fall, but we never break
Dancing through the storm, no time for hate
Together we stand, with love as our stake
In this journey of life, let the music take

[chorus]
Put your hands up, like you don't know
Point at your feet, let the rhythm flow
Life's got its ups and downs, but we glow
In the midst of chaos, watch us grow
