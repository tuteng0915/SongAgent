User : 
I want a rock song with a male vocalist, and it should be themed for Halloween. Can you start working on that?

Sure, I can start working on that. Since you want a rock song with a male vocalist themed for Halloween, I will set the tags to "rock, male vocalist, halloween". Let me prepare the lyrics too.

I've prepared a rock song with a male vocalist themed for Halloween. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
In the shadows of the night
Where ghouls and ghosts take flight
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
[verse]
The moon is full, casting spells
The witching hour tolls its bells
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
[bridge]
Trick or treat, in disguises
Mysteries under pumpkin skies
[chorus]
Halloween, it's here again
The monsters rise from darkened dens
