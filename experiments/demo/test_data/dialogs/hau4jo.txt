I'd like to create a song that tells a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. Can we start with a chorus that shows they are in love despite the odds? Something like "Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo."
Agent : 
Sure, that's a great start for the chorus. Before we proceed further with the lyrics and to ensure the song truly captures the essence of a modern Romeo and Juliet, could you provide more details? For example, do you prefer a specific music genre or any particular theme for the tags such as 'modern', 'urban', 'romantic', etc.? Also, should the verses tell more of their individual struggles or focus on their encounters and shared moments?
User : 
Let's go with a modern and urban theme. For the verses, I want to highlight their individual struggles, like Juliet's father reading her text messages, which complicates their relationship. And maybe touch on how they find ways to communicate despite that.

I've set the tags for your song to reflect a modern, urban, romantic, and dramatic theme. Here are the initial lyrics including the chorus and two verses that touch on their struggles and how they communicate:

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
In a world that tries to pull them apart, their hearts still hold on
Through the chaos and the city lights, they've found their secret code
Romeo and Juliet, a love that will never let go

[verse 1]
Juliet writes her dreams in a text so sweet
But her father's watchful eyes, make her heartbeat skip a beat
Every message scrutinized, every word a mystery
Yet through the digital maze, her love finds its way discreetly

[pre-chorus]
They find signals in silence, whispers in the noise
A modern tale of two souls, with a love that never cloys

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
In a world that tries to pull them apart, their hearts still hold on
Through the chaos and the city lights, they've found their secret code
Romeo and Juliet, a love that will never let go

[verse 2]
Romeo walks the streets, under neon skies
His phone buzzes softly, as he reads her goodnight sighs
In the shadows of the alleys, where secrets often hide
Their connection grows stronger, with every moment they confide

The lyrics are shaping up well. I'm thinking of an emotional yet vibrant vibe for the song, with a deep and soulful singer's voice. Can we also hint at a backstory for the singer, perhaps involving resilience or past injury? And keep the rhythm upbeat for dancing. Let's generate this version.
