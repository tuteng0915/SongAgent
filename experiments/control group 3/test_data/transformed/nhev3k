Hey there! I need you to generate a song for me. Here's what I'm looking for:  

It should be a popular dance/party song from the last couple of years, with a catchy EDM vibe. There’s a part where a female voice says "dance dance dance" right before the beat drops, and then it continues faintly in the background after the drop. It’s super energetic and perfect for getting people moving on the dance floor.  

Can you create something like that?
