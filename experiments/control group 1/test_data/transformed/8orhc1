Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique request for you. I'd like you to generate a catchy rock/electronic style song based on some vague memories I have of a music video. Here are the details:

- The main character in the video is a guy playing what might be a guitar or a keyboard guitar.
- The setting is around a building with different apartments.
- The overall vibe of the song is a blend of rock and electronic music.

Could you please create a song that fits these criteria? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
