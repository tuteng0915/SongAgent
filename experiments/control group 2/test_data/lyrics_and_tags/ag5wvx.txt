Lyrics :
[intro]
Ha ha, ha ha, mmhmm, mmhmm
Ha ha, ha ha, mmhmm, mmhmm

[verse]
In a world where socks have wings,
and pancakes grow on tree branches.
A purple cat with orange eyes,
is knitting scarves for all the fishes.
Underneath the rainbow sea,
a dancing fox in moonlit glades.

[chorus]
Do you think it's that easy?
Holding onto dreams so cheesy?
Do you really think it's true?
Chasing shadows, losing you.

[bridge]
Let's twist reality, break free from these chains,
Dive into the unknown, feel the fire in our veins.

[chorus]
Do you think it's that simple?
Walking paths so brittle?
Do you really think it's real?
Facing fears, breaking seals.
