Hello, song generating agent! I'm looking to create a song based on some specific features. The song should be heartfelt and emotional, with lyrics that could move someone to tears. It should be accompanied by a guitar, giving it an acoustic feel. The song shouldn't sound too mainstream, as if it could be something you'd find among hidden gems on YouTube with fewer views.

The key line for the song, which should appear towards the end, is: "I finally remember the sound you used to call me."

Could you help generate such a song for me? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
