Looks like we're starting from scratch! Let me know when you're ready to refine the song further.
Agent : 
Since both the tags and lyrics are currently empty, it seems we haven't started generating the song yet. To get started, I'll first need to gather some information about your preferences.

Could you please provide me with details on:
1. The genre or style of music you prefer (e.g., pop, rock, classical)?
2. Any specific themes or emotions you'd like the song to convey?
3. If you have any particular lyrics or sections in mind that you'd like included?

Once I have this information, I can generate a set of tags and lyrics that align with your vision.

Sure thing! I'm thinking of something in the country genre, maybe with an upbeat tempo. It would be great if it captured the spirit of cowboy life and rodeos. Does that help narrow it down?

Great! With your preferences in mind, I've set the tags for the song to "country, upbeat, cowboy life, rodeo". Now let's move on to crafting some lyrics that capture the essence of cowboy life and rodeos. I'll draft a few sections including a verse, chorus, and bridge. 

Hereâ€™s a preliminary draft:

[Verse]
Out on the range where the wild winds blow
Horses run free, man it's quite a show
Sunset skies paint the evening glow
In this land of dreams, hearts are bound to grow

[Chorus]
Saddle up cowboys, it's time to ride
With the stars above as our guide
Rodeo nights, under neon lights
Living that cowboy life, everything feels right

[Bridge]
Dust kicks up as we dance through the night
Laughter fills air, everything feels so right
Spurs jingle jangle, boots tapping tight
In this rodeo town, every momentâ€™s a delight

Please review these lyrics and let me know if thereâ€™s anything youâ€™d like to change or add. Once youâ€™re happy with them, press the "generate" button to create the song.

The lyrics look good so far, but I was hoping for a faster tempo that people could line dance to. Could you tweak it to make it more lively and energetic? Also, can we include the line "Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton" somewhere noticeable?

I've updated the tags to include "fast tempo" and "line dance" to make the song more lively and suitable for line dancing. Additionally, I've incorporated the line "Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton" into the chorus to make it more noticeable.

Here are the revised lyrics:

[Verse]
Out on the range where the wild winds blow
Horses run fast, man it's quite a show
Sunset skies paint the evening glow
In this land of dreams, hearts are bound to grow

[Chorus]
Saddle up cowboys, it's time to ride
With the stars above as our guide
Rodeo nights, under neon lights
Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton, everything feels right

[Bridge]
Dust kicks up as we dance through the night
Laughter fills air, everything feels so right
Spurs jingle jangle, boots tapping tight
In this rodeo town, every momentâ€™s a delight

[Outro]
Fast tempo beats, letâ€™s line dance tonight
In cowboy boots, under starry light
