User : 
I'd be happy to help with that! Let's start by specifying the genre and mood of the song. Since you mentioned it should be happy and funny, do you have a specific genre in mind, like pop, rock, or something else?
Agent : 
To better understand your preferences, I will first get the user preference details.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since we don't have specific preferences on file for you yet, let's go with a pop genre for our happy and funny song. Pop music tends to be catchy and upbeat, which fits well with the mood we're aiming for.

Now I will set the tags for the song as "pop, happy, funny" and begin drafting some lyrics.

Great! With the tags set, let's draft some lyrics for our song. Hereâ€™s a basic structure:

[verse]
In the middle of the day, I saw you in the park,
Jumping on the trampoline with your polka dot bark,
Squirrels were clapping, birds were singing too,
Life is just so funny when it's shared with you.

[chorus]
We laugh, we dance, spinning round and round,
Happy days are here, joyous feet off the ground,
Funny faces made at the fountain splash,
Every moment feels like a joyful dash.

[bridge]
Even the clouds giggle as they pass by,
And the sun can't help but wink from the sky,
Let's keep this tune going, never let it stop,
In this pop parade, life's a happy shop.
