Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows where demons prance,
Feel the rhythm of the devil's dance.
Heart is pounding, can't take a chance,
We'll light it up with one last dance.

[chorus]
Woo woo, under neon skies,
Dancing with the devil, no disguise.
Woo woo, feel the fever rise,
This is our moment, paradise!

[verse]
Electric pulses through the air,
Spirits high, there's no despair.
The night is ours, we own this place,
With every step, we leave a trace.

[chorus]
Woo woo, under neon skies,
Dancing with the devil, no disguise.
Woo woo, feel the fever rise,
This is our moment, paradise!

[bridge]
The clock is ticking, but we don't care,
Lost in the music, love is rare.
Raise your hands, let the feeling enhance,
Together we'll conquer the devilâ€™s dance.

[chorus]
Woo woo, under neon skies,
Dancing with the devil, no disguise.
Woo woo, feel the fever rise,
This is our moment, paradise!
