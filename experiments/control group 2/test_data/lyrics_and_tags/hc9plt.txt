Lyrics :
[verse]
I can't believe it, the way the sun sets in hues
Can you feel it, like morning dews?
Every moment feels borrowed, yet so true
In this world to realize, dreams do renew

[chorus]
Ohhhh but I —- hold on to the past
While stepping into the unknown so vast
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
I find my way under the open sky

[verse]
Walking paths less traveled, feeling free
I can't believe it's taken all this time to see
The beauty hidden in the simplest of things
A melody played on love's gentle strings

[chorus]
Ohhhh but I —- embrace what I've found
In the silence between the heartbeats profound
Can you feel it? A connection so deep
In the world to realize, secrets we keep

[bridge]
Through trials and triumphs, through joy and pain
Life unfolds like a sweet refrain
Each note a story, each song a memory
Together they weave our tapestry
