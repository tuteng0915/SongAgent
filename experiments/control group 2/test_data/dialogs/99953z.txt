Hello, song generating agent! I would like you to create a song based on the following requirements:

The song should be in the style of electronic music from the 2010s, reminiscent of Empire of the Sun, MGMT, or Passion Pit. It should feature a male singer or singers and include a jazz-like part at the very end as the music fades out.

Could you please generate a song with these features? Thank you!

[verse]
Dancing in the twilight, neon colors in the air,
Weâ€™re chasing shadows, moving without a care.

[chorus]
Sunset melodies take us higher,
Empire lights, they ignite the fire.
In this moment, we own the night,
With every beat, our spirits alight.

[verse]
Golden waves crash under moonlit skies,
Electric dreams in our eyes.

[chorus]
Sunset melodies take us higher,
Empire lights, they ignite the fire.
In this moment, we own the night,
With every beat, our spirits alight.

[bridge]
As the night fades to grey,
The rhythm takes us away.

[outro]
Now the tempo slows, with a gentle breeze,
A saxophone whispers through the trees.
