Lyrics :
[verse]
In the hush of twilight's glow
Whispers of the rain I know
Each droplet sings its ancient song
Secrets carried, deep and strong

[chorus]
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown

[verse]
Clouds converge in a dance so free
Veiling skies in their mystery
I hear your voice in every fall
A symphony where shadows call

[chorus]
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown

[bridge]
And when the world is dry and bare
I'll find the rain, it will still be there
Echoes linger, soft and warm
In every storm, there's a soothing calm

[chorus]
Rain, painting stories on my window pane
Rain, weaving dreams in the gentle refrain
I walk with you through misty streets unknown
With every shower, seeds of hope are sown
