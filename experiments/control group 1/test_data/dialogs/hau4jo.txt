User : 
I'd like to create a song that tells a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. The chorus should capture their mutual feelings for each other, something like "Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo." Can we start with that?

Sure, let's create a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet in song form. I'll start by setting the tags that match the theme and then draft some initial lyrics for the chorus based on your input.

Calling the param_setter tool now to set the tags and lyrics.

I've set the stage with some tags and written a draft for the chorus. Here's what we have so far:

Tags: modern, love, tragic, romance

Lyrics:
```
[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
In a world that tries to tear their love apart, they hold on tight
Through the chaos and the whispers, their hearts beat as one
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
```
