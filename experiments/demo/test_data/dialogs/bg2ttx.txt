User : 
I want a song that's like a mix between pop and rap, something that gives us that nostalgic feel of being a kid, just like in MGMT's "Kids." Can you start by sketching out an intro?
Agent : 
Sure, I can create an intro that blends pop and rap elements while evoking nostalgia. Let me set the tags to capture the essence of what you're looking for and draft an intro section for the lyrics.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
To ensure the song aligns with your preferences, could you please specify any themes, emotions, or specific elements you'd like included in the track? For instance, do you prefer a more upbeat tempo or something slower and reflective? Any particular subject matter you'd want the lyrics to touch upon?

With the tags set to encapsulate a mix of pop and rap with a nostalgic nod to MGMT's "Kids," here's an intro sketch:

[intro]
<|start_time|>Bittersweet<|end_time|> melodies, <start_time|>80s synths<|end_time|> collide,
<|start_time|>Boom-bap<|end_time|> beats, we're on a ride,
Back to when the world was <start_time|>carefree<|end_time|>,
A time so <start_time|>wistful<|end_time|>, yet it felt so right.

The intro has been set, capturing the nostalgic and anthemic vibe you're looking for. If you're satisfied with this introduction, please press the "generate" button to start creating the song. We can then build upon this foundation, adding verses, choruses, and other elements as needed. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust before generating.
User : 
The intro is nice, but can we make it a bit more dreamy? And add some keywords related to youth like 'child' and 'kid'?
Agent : 
Certainly! To achieve a dreamier feel, I'll adjust the tags to include elements that evoke a more ethereal atmosphere. Additionally, I'll incorporate the keywords 'child' and 'kid' into the intro lyrics.

Let's update these parameters now.

I've updated the intro lyrics to include a dreamier atmosphere and incorporated references to 'child' and 'kid'. Here's the revised version:

[intro]
Bittersweet melodies, 80s synths collide,
Boom-bap beats, we're on a ride,
Back to when the world was carefree,
A time so wistful, yet it felt so right,
Dreamy echoes of a child's laughter,
In the heart of every kid, magic will follow.

If this aligns with your vision, please press "generate" to bring this dreamier and more youth-oriented intro to life. Let me know if there are any further adjustments you'd like to make.
