Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song for me instead of finding one. Here’s what I’m looking for:  

It should have a short saxophone intro—just 10 notes—that repeats a few times. The first note of the sax part should feel slower and smoother than the rest, creating this really cool, bold vibe when played loudly (think digital sax). After that intro, transition into a slow-paced pop song with a female singer, something along the lines of M83 or Grouplove—kind of dreamy, hippie-like vibes but still modern and chill.  

Can you create something based on these details?
