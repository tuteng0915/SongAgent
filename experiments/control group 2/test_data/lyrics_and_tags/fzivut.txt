Lyrics :
[verse]
You'll be the reason I'm alive
You were the best thing in my life

[chorus]
YOU! Are always in my mind
Every breath you take, every move you make
I fall for you all over again

[bridge]
In your eyes, I see forever
In your arms, I've found my home

[chorus]
YOU! Are always in my mind
Every heartbeat whispers your name
In your love, I have found my sanctuary
