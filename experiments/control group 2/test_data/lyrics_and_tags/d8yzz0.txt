Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of silence,
No one around, feels so violent.
I'm staring at the ceiling high,
Wondering if I'll ever fly.

[chorus]
You're gonna leave me here on my own,
In this cold world, I'm lost, I'm thrown.
Every heartbeat's a ticking bomb,
Gonna leave me here, can't find a home.

[verse]
Walking down these lonely streets,
Counting shadows, counting beats.
I hear your voice in every song,
But itâ€™s been wrong, it's been so long.

[chorus]
You're gonna leave me here on my own,
In this cold world, I'm lost, I'm thrown.
Every heartbeat's a ticking bomb,
Gonna leave me here, can't find a home.

[bridge]
If I could turn back time,
I'd rewrite every line.
But you're already gone,
And I'm left with this song.
