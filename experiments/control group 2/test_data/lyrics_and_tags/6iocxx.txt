Lyrics :
[verse]
On a beach where the nights are warm,
In a hammock swaying under the storm,
Of stars that dance and the moon so bright,
There's a man with not much but his heart to give tonight.

[chorus]
Oh girl, take my hand,
Let's run away in this sandy land,
I may not have riches or treasures untold,
But I'll give you my heart, more precious than gold.

[verse]
By the fire where the flames reach high,
Underneath the vast and endless sky,
The sound of guitars and laughter fills the air,
With friends around us, life seems so fair.

[bridge]
Parked beside the waves is an old VW van,
A symbol of freedom, of life on the run,
It may not be much, but it's our little dream,
Together we'll travel, together we'll gleam.

[chorus]
Oh girl, take my hand,
Let's journey forth in this wonderland,
I may not own a palace or a crown,
But with you by my side, I'm never alone.

[finale]
As the night fades away and the morning begins,
The rhythm of our hearts, a melody that wins,
We'll sing to the sea, to the love that we've found,
In this moment forever, our souls are unbound.
