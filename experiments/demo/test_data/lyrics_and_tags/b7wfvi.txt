Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the sound of a distant echo
In this place where shadows dance and time flows slow-mo
There's a nurse with eyes like morning skies
She holds two pills, choices in disguise

[chorus]
Cool is the calm before I choose my fate
Trapped between reality and what can't wait
With every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm walking on a tightrope, trying not to break

[verse]
Days blur into nights, dreams intertwine
A labyrinth of thoughts, searching for a sign
Her gentle voice cuts through the haze
"Choose wisely," she says, as if in a daze

[chorus]
Cool is the calm before I choose my fate
Trapped between reality and what can't wait
With every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm walking on a tightrope, trying not to break

[bridge]
One pill will heal, one pill will mend
Which path leads home? Where do I descend?
I close my eyes, let intuition guide
Feel the weight of worlds where truth may hide

[outro]
Now it's done, decision made, no turning back
Heart pounding loud, future wrapped in black
But peace descends, an unexpected grace
As cool takes over, replacing all that space
