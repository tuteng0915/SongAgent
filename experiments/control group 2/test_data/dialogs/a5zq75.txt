Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song based on the following details. The song should be an EDM/pop genre with a female vocalist and have an adventurous, unusual pop vibe. The theme of the lyrics should revolve around a dream state and a difficult relationship. Here are some lines that should be included in the lyrics: «I see how you think I'm crazy, but you're the one that run and hide» and «I want to believe in the lie of the dream». I hope this challenge excites you as much as it does me. Let's create something amazing together!

[verse]
I see how you think I'm crazy
But you're the one that run and hide
In this world of make-believe
Where nothing is as it seems

[chorus]
I want to believe in the lie of the dream
To find a way when we're lost in between
Together we'll wander through this maze
Hoping to find our way back to the real

[verse]
A difficult relationship we share
Bound by threads invisible yet there
Through every twist and every turn
We learn to let go, we learn to burn

[chorus]
I want to believe in the lie of the dream
To find a way when we're lost in between
Together we'll wander through this maze
Hoping to find our way back to the real

[bridge]
Oh, we dive deep into the unknown
Where shadows dance and secrets are shown
In this dream state, we'll find our truth
A journey of self, a quest for proof

[chorus]
I want to believe in the lie of the dream
To find a way when we're lost in between
Together we'll wander through this maze
Hoping to find our way back to the real
