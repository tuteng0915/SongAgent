Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the alleyways he roams,
A cityscape where danger calls it home,
Caught within a web not of his own making,
Fighting for freedom, no time for breaking.

[chorus]
Everything goes on and on and on,
In this urban labyrinth where he's gone,
With every step, a new scene unfolds,
A noir odyssey, in hues of gold.

[verse]
Hospital walls with their sterile embrace,
A nurse with a smile that conceals her face,
Malevolence cloaked in white attire,
Our hero dreams of flight and fire.

[bridge]
Cardboard wings beat against the night,
A silhouette takes its daring flight,
From the windowsill to the open skies,
A phoenix rising as the world defies.

[chorus]
Everything goes on and on and on,
The city whispers till the break of dawn,
Through the chaos, he finds his way,
In the heart of darkness, he will not stay.
