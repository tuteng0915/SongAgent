Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, listen up, it's the sound of the beat,
Droppin' bombs, make the crowd just seat.
Every single word I say is true,
Feel the energy? That's right, it's YOUU!

[chorus]
The rhythm's got you movin', no time to stall,
Pumpin' up the volume, we're havin' a ball.
I'm talkin' 'bout the hype, never out of sight,
Shout it out loud, feel the power tonight! YOUU!

[verse]
Step by step, we march to the rhyme,
The bass is heavy, let it take your mind.
On this track, there's nothing taboo,
When it comes to the vibe, it's all on YOUU!

[bridge]
Raise your hands and feel the rush,
In this moment, there's no such thing as blush.
We create the wave, let it break through,
And ride this high, me and YOUU!

[chorus]
The rhythm's got you movin', no time to stall,
Pumpin' up the volume, we're havin' a ball.
I'm talkin' 'bout the hype, never out of sight,
Shout it out loud, feel the power tonight! YOUU!

[ending]
Keep the beat alive, don't ever subdue,
The party doesn't start till I shout out YOUU!
