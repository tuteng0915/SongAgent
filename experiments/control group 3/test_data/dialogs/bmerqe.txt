I need a song that starts with an old man in a hospital bed, and then a woman comes in singing "Do you remember" with a marching band. It should have flashbacks and be like Florence and the Machine.
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's break down the elements you've mentioned to create a fitting song.

1. **Starting Scene**: An old man in a hospital bed.
2. **Entry and Singing**: A woman enters singing "Do you remember" accompanied by a marching band.
3. **Flashbacks**: The song should evoke a sense of nostalgia or memory recall.
4. **Style**: Resembling Florence and the Machine.

First, let's set some tags that align with your vision, particularly focusing on creating a soundscape that is evocative and rich, akin to Florence and the Machine, but also incorporating elements of a marching band for that powerful entrance.

I will now gather more specific preferences and then set the initial tags and lyrics structure.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
It seems we need to define some more specific details about the style and mood you're aiming for. Florence and the Machine are known for their powerful, ethereal sound with strong vocal performances and a rich orchestration.

Do you have any preferences on:
- The theme or emotion of the song (e.g., melancholic, uplifting, bittersweet)?
- Specific instruments besides the marching band elements?
- Any particular tempo or key?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
User : 
I think the song should feel bittersweet, with a powerful and ethereal sound. Maybe include some piano and strings along with the marching band. The tempo can be moderate, not too fast or slow.

Great! I've set the tags for your song to reflect a bittersweet, powerful, and ethereal sound with piano, strings, marching band elements, and a moderate tempo inspired by Florence and the Machine.

Now, let's draft the initial lyrics structure. Hereâ€™s what we can start with:

- **[Verse]**: Setting the scene with the old man in the hospital bed.
- **[Chorus]**: The woman enters singing "Do you remember," evoking flashbacks.
- **[Bridge]**: A flashback sequence capturing key moments or emotions.

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like included in these sections or any other changes before finalizing the lyrics draft.

The lyrics have been set with your specified themes and imagery. Here's the draft:

- **[Verse]**:  
  In the quiet room where shadows play,  
  An old man lies, his hair turned gray.  
  Memories flicker, like lights that fade,  
  Within the walls where time has stayed.  

- **[Chorus]**:  
  Do you remember, the days gone by?  
  When dreams were young and spirits high.  
  With every note, her voice takes flight,  
  A marching band ignites the night.  

- **[Bridge]**:  
  Flashbacks dance, of laughter sweet,  
  Of battles fought and hearts that beat.  
  Through fields of gold, through stormy weather,  
  Moments cherished, binding us forever.

The lyrics look good, but can we add something about dancing on a hillside in the bridge? Other than that, I think it's perfect.

I've updated the lyrics to include "Dancing on a hillside under skies so wide" in the bridge section. Here's the revised version:

- **[Verse]**:  
  In the quiet room where shadows play,  
  An old man lies, his hair turned gray.  
  Memories flicker, like lights that fade,  
  Within the walls where time has stayed.  

- **[Chorus]**:  
  Do you remember, the days gone by?  
  When dreams were young and spirits high.  
  With every note, her voice takes flight,  
  A marching band ignites the night.  

- **[Bridge]**:  
  Flashbacks dance, of laughter sweet,  
  Of battles fought and hearts that beat.  
  Dancing on a hillside under skies so wide,  
  Through fields of gold, through stormy weather,  
  Moments cherished, binding us forever.  

The lyrics now capture the additional imagery you requested.
