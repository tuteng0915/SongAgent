Lyrics :
[intro]
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana
La la la la, la la la la

[verse 1]
Walking down these familiar streets
Where echoes of our laughter meet
I remember those summer nights
Underneath the starlit skies so bright

[chorus]
Oh, how we danced in the moonlight glow
With melodies that only we would know
In this small town, where dreams unfold
Our story is written in the sands of old

[verse 2]
The river whispers your name again
As I stroll along its gentle bend
Memories flood like an ocean's tide
Carrying me back to when we tried

[chorus]
Oh, how we danced in the moonlight glow
With melodies that only we would know
In this small town, where dreams unfold
Our story is written in the sands of old

[bridge]
Time moves on but some things remain
A timeless tune that soothes the pain
Of fleeting moments we hold so dear
In the corners of our hearts, they're near

[outro]
Naa nananana nanananaa nanana Nana
La la la la, la la la la
