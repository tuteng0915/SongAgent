Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song that fits the following description:

The genre could be rock, blues rock, or even Motown. The song should feature a chorus with several people singing "...doin' all right..." with a short instrumental interlude followed shortly by the same phrase again "...doin' all right...".

Additionally, there may or may not be another lyric in the song that's either "...write me a letter..." or "...write you a letter...".

I'm excited to hear what you come up with! Let's generate this song together.
