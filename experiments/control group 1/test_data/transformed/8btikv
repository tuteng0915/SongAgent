Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that matches some specific vibes. It needs to be upbeat with a tropical feel, kind of like those songs that came out around 2014-2016. It should also be a love song, featuring two male African artists—though they don’t have to be American-based. The lyrics can be in English or another language, but the overall tone should evoke that warm, summery energy. Think you can whip something up like that?
