Lyrics :
[verse]
In this submerged sanctuary we find
Two hearts adrift in an endless tide
Shadows dance on the ocean floor
A world unknown lies within our door

[chorus]
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky
We drift together, you and I
No need for words beneath the waves
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save

[verse]
Neon corals light up the night
Reflections shimmering out of sight
Our fingers brush as we navigate
This maze of memories we create

[chorus]
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky
We drift together, you and I
No need for words beneath the waves
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save

[bridge]
The surface feels so far away
But here below, we've found our stay
Where time dissolves like grains of sand
And dreams take shape at every hand

[chorus]
Bubbles rise through a liquid sky
We drift together, you and I
No need for words beneath the waves
Just echoes of secrets that time won't save

[outro]
Fading whispers, the current takes
A love unspoken, the silence makes
An endless loop, no start or end
Forever yours, forever my friend
