Lyrics :
[verse]
Skateboard wheels roll down the street
A kid with a dream and two bare feet
Laundromat lights, they flicker and glow
Quirky faces putting on a show

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[verse]
There's a girl with fire in her eyes
Her boyfriend's phone meets an early demise
But then she sees him, the skateboarding star
Suddenly he's stealing her heart

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[bridge]
The band plays on as the front-line guard
Curly hair swaying, setting the standard
Wild moves flying, clothes spinning round
In this chaotic party town

[chorus]
Oh, we're dancing in the suds tonight
In this crazy laundromat delight
Glitter braids and feathers too
Everyone's here, me and you

[outro]
As the night fades to a memory bright
The kid and the girl sneak out under moonlight
Laundry forgotten, but who really cares?
The rhythm stays with us unawares
