User : 
I'd be happy to help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre and the overall mood of the song. Since you mentioned it's uptempo, do you have a specific genre in mind, or should I suggest one?

To better assist you, let's first determine your preferences. I'll go ahead and fetch those details for us.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since we don't have your specific preferences on file, I'll suggest a genre and mood that often works well for an uptempo song. How about an energetic pop song with a positive and uplifting vibe?

If this sounds good to you, I can proceed with generating the lyrics and setting the appropriate tags. If you have another genre or mood in mind, please let me know!
