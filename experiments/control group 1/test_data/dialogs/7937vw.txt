User : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre of the song. What kind of genre are we looking at? Something like alternative rock, pop, or maybe even a ballad?

To better assist you, could you please specify your preferences? I'll use the preference tool to gather more information about what you're looking for.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences yet, let's go with a general approach. How about we create an alternative rock song? This genre often has a good balance of energy and depth. If you agree, I will proceed to set the tags and lyrics for this type of song.

If you have any other preferences or specific details you'd like to include, please let me know!

I've set the tags and lyrics for an alternative rock song. Here's a preview:

**Tags:** alternative rock, energetic, melodic

**Lyrics:**
```
[verse]
In the shadows of the night
We find our way through the fight

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry

[verse]
Every step, every fall
We'll break free, stand tall

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry

[bridge]
Together we stand, hearts in hand
Facing the world, we make our stand

[chorus]
Rise above, touch the sky
Feel the rush, hear the cry
```
