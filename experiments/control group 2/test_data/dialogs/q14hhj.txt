Hello, song generating agent! I'm looking to create a song based on some specific features. The song should be heartfelt and emotional, with lyrics that could move someone to tears. It should be accompanied by a guitar, giving it an acoustic feel. The song shouldn't sound too mainstream, as if it could be something you'd find among hidden gems on YouTube with fewer views.

The key line for the song, which should appear towards the end, is: "I finally remember the sound you used to call me."

Could you help generate such a song for me? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!

```
[verse]
In the quiet of the night I hear,
a whisper in the wind so clear.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[verse]
Beneath the silver moon's soft glow,
I search for pieces of us to show.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[bridge]
Every strum on my guitar sings,
of moments we lived, of everything.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[final]
And as the silence wraps around,
I finally remember the sound you used to call me.
