Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

I need your help generating a song that fits the following description: It should have a slow, melancholic tone, almost like opera music, with a cinematic and emotional feel. The lyrics are sparse, but there’s a haunting line sung by a female voice that goes something like "some say (that/what) the." The style should evoke sadness, making it suitable for use in dramatic scenes from movies or TV shows. While I associate this type of song with the 90s, it doesn’t have to strictly belong to that era—it just needs to capture that timeless, moody vibe. Can you create something based on these details?
