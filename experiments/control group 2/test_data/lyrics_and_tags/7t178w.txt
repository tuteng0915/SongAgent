Lyrics :
[verse]
Baby take my hand
We'll walk through this land
Where shadows fall and time stands still

[chorus]
Oh baby, baby, won't you stay
Baby, baby, here with me today

[breakdown]
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby (rising scale)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby (falling scale)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby right (ending)
