Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that reminds me of kids or teenage years, specifically involving school. The vibe should be something from around 2010-2014, and it would be great if the intro could feel familiar, like it's been used in multiple songs before. Let's create something that captures those nostalgic vibes of youth and school life! Can you work your magic and come up with some lyrics and tags for this kind of song?
