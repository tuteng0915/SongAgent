Lyrics :
[Intro]
Clean guitar strums

[Verse 1]
Silent walls, they whisper your name,
In the shadows where secrets remain.
I've walked these halls, I've felt the pain,
But tonight, we rise from the stain.

[Chorus]
Why do you wanna die, when there's life in your eyes?
We can find a way to see the sunrise.
With every tear, with every lie,
Together we'll learn how to truly fly.

[Verse 2]
Every scar tells a story untold,
Of battles fought and hearts that unfold.
Through the storm, we'll find our way,
To brighter days, come what may.

[Chorus]
Why do you wanna die, when there's life in your eyes?
We can find a way to see the sunrise.
With every tear, with every lie,
Together we'll learn how to truly fly.

[Bridge]
The night is long, but love is stronger,
Hold on to me, I won't let go longer.
Feel the beat of a heart that's yearning,
For peace, for joy, for all that's worth learning.

[Outro]
Fuller rock sound fades out...
