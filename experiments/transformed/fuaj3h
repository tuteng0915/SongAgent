Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song based on some specific features. The song should be in the emo/punk genre, with a sad and eerie vibe. It needs to have vocals from a female singer, and possibly a male vocalist as well. The lyrics should revolve around themes of numbness, inability to feel, or perhaps struggling to move or breathe. Let’s create something that captures these emotions and fits the style. Can you work your magic?
