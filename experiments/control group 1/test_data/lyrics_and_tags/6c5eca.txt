Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I think of you
Our story unfolds, like morning dew

[chorus]
You're my sunrise, my sunset too
The sky where my dreams renew
With every heartbeat, I'm closer to you
Together, we'll chase the horizon's hue

[verse]
Walking hand in hand, under starlit skies
Every moment with you, feels like a surprise

[bridge]
Time stands still when you're near
Love speaks louder than words can hear

[chorus]
You're my sunrise, my sunset too
The sky where my dreams renew
With every heartbeat, I'm closer to you
Together, we'll chase the horizon's hue
