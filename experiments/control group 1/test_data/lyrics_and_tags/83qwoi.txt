Lyrics :
[verse]
Rising up from the ashes of doubt
Every step forward is a victory shout
[chorus]
Unstoppable force, breaking through the night
With every heartbeat, we ignite the light
[bridge]
We've come too far to fall back now
With our heads held high, we take the vow
[chorus]
Unstoppable force, breaking through the night
With every heartbeat, we ignite the light
[verse]
In the face of adversity, we stand tall
Our dreams are the fuel, they will never stall
