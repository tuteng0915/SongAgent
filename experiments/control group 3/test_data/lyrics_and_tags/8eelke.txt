Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light,
I strum my dreams on an old guitar.
Each note a whisper, each chord a sigh,
Of days gone by, where memories linger near.

[chorus]
Oh, these strings hold stories untold,
Of love and loss, of hearts grown cold.
But in this silence, they find their way,
To speak of hope, come what may.

[verse]
Beneath the shade of the willow tree,
Where time stands still, and so do I.
With every pluck, a memory flows,
Through rivers deep, where shadows lie.

[chorus]
Oh, these strings hold stories untold,
Of love and loss, of hearts grown cold.
But in this silence, they find their way,
To speak of hope, come what may.

[bridge]
And though the world may spin so fast,
These moments last, they always last.
In every echo, in every sound,
There's peace to be found, when you're not bound.

[falsetto]
She crazy...
Ooooh ooooh ooooh oooh...
Ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh aaah...
