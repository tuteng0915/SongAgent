User : 
Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits the vibe of something from the early 2000s or late 90s. The voice should have that distinct computer-generated feel, and I’m not sure if it’s male or female—so maybe we can play around with both? As for the video concept, I’d like it to be similar to *"Wear Sunscreen"* with random shots throughout. Let's create something nostalgic yet fresh! Can you work your magic and generate this for me?

Alright, I've set up the tags and lyrics for your nostalgic yet fresh song that captures the essence of the early 2000s or late 90s. The computer-generated voice will give it that distinct retro feel we're aiming for, and we can experiment with both male and female vocals.

Here are the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Remember when the world stood still,
Dancing to a dial-up's shrill.
We had dreams and pixel dreams,
Living life inside our screens.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.

[verse]
Walking down these memory lanes,
Through the joys, the trends, the pains.
Neon lights on a discman glow,
Time was gold; it moved so slow.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.

[bridge]
So wear your sunscreen, chase the sun,
Let the nostalgia have its fun.
From chatrooms to mixtape cassettes,
It’s all within us, no regrets.

[chorus]
Oh, those days, they came and went,
In a flash of light, we grew content.
With every byte, with every code,
A story in the static told.
```
