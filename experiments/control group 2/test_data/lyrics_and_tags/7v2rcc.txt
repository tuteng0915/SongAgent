Lyrics :
[intro]
Go and leave me
Standing here in the shadows

[verse 1]
I'm caught up in this moment
Can't escape from myself
Every turn I take leads me back
To where I started

[chorus]
Everything will be alright alright
Even when the world is falling apart
We'll find a way to make it through the night alright
With our hearts on fire, we'll light up the dark

[verse 2]
The clock keeps ticking
But time stands still for us
In this crazy game of life
We're just trying to survive

[chorus]
Everything will be alright alright
Even when the world is falling apart
We'll find a way to make it through the night alright
With our hearts on fire, we'll light up the dark

[bridge]
It's not about where you've been
It's where you're going that counts
Let's hit the road and never look back

[chorus]
Everything will be alright alright
Even when the world is falling apart
We'll find a way to make it through the night alright
With our hearts on fire, we'll light up the dark
