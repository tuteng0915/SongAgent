Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. I want it to be something newerish, not an older classic like "Sweet Caroline." The song should have a soft rock or folky feel to it. I’m thinking of lyrics that might sound something like, "Oh oh feeeoline, I've been lost since the ????" — you get the drift. Can you generate something with that kind of mood and style?

I have set the tags and lyrics for your song according to the soft rock or folky feel you were looking for. Here is a glimpse of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
Oh oh feeeoline,
I've been lost since the days gone by,
Walking down this lonely road,
Underneath the open sky.

[chorus]
Guide me home, through the night,
Be my beacon, be my light,
In this world of fleeting time,
Hold me close, let us align.

[verse]
Rivers flow and winds they sing,
Stories of the wandering,
Every step a memory,
In the heart where shadows cling.

[bridge]
And if the stars should fall tonight,
We'll find our way, we'll be alright,
Together bound by threads unseen,
In this dance of life, serene.

[chorus]
Guide me home, through the night,
Be my beacon, be my light,
In this world of fleeting time,
Hold me close, let us align.
