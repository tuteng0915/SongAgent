Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the carousel night
Where shadows dance under electric light
I see your face in a neon glow
Lost in the rhythm, let the music flow

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[verse]
Underneath the painted sky
A melody calls as the moments fly
Faded stars and spinning wheels
Holding on to what the night reveals

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[bridge]
The organ plays a haunting tune
Like whispers carried by the moon
Step closer, don't be afraid
This carnival never truly fades

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[outro]
As the night begins to fade
The music lingers, a serenade
Of all we've found and all we've lost
Within this endless carousel's frost
