I'd love to create a song based on your story. Could you tell me more about the emotions the boy is feeling during these scenes?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To better understand the emotional landscape of the song, could you please provide some context or details about the scenes and the boy's feelings? For instance, is he experiencing joy, sadness, confusion, or perhaps a mix of emotions? Any specific moments or actions that stand out?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to craft a song that truly captures the essence of his journey.
