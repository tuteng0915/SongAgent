I’d like you to generate a song that fits this description: it should have a 70s-80s rock vibe, featuring an instrument that sounds like a fairground organ or accordion. The tone of the song should be neutral—not too sad, but not overly happy either. It should feel repetitive and hypnotic in its structure. The singer should be male, with a youthful voice, sounding like he’s in his 20s or early 30s. Let’s create something unique based on these features!

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Riding on the carousel
Round and round we go
Lights are flashing in the night
In this little show

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars

[verse]
Laughter echoes through the air
As the music sways
Lost within this timeless dance
Where the moment stays

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars

[bridge]
Time slips away unnoticed
In this carousel of sound
Lost souls find their rhythm
Going round and round

[chorus]
We're spinning endlessly
Caught in a melody
Fairground dreams linger on
Underneath the stars
