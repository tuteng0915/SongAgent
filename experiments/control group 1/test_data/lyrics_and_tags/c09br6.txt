Lyrics :
[verse]
Riff blazing through the night
Feel the thunder, see the light
Every strum, a heartbeat's call
Metal strings, they won't stall

[chorus]
Rock it up, rock it loud
Chanting strong, chanting proud
Echoes fly in the gym air
Raise your hands if you dare

[verse]
Power chords cut like a knife
Slicing through the workout strife
With every beat, we're moving fast
Onward till the very last

[chorus]
Rock it up, rock it loud
Chanting strong, chanting proud
Echoes fly in the gym air
Raise your hands if you dare

[bridge]
Bass drum pounding deep
Cymbals crash, spirits leap
Together now, break the chain
Feel alive through the pain
