Lyrics :
[verse]
Concrete jungle, where the hustlers unite,
Underneath the streetlights, in the city's fight.
Voices echo loud, like a symphony of plight,
But there's beauty in the struggle, shining through the night.

[chorus]
Boom bap beats, soulful and deep,
Every rhyme we spit, secrets that we keep.
From the Jordan to Jabbar-Jebbar when I get stoned like Sharon from Sliver,
The pulse of the city, in our veins it runs,
Gritty tales of glory, sung by the unsung ones.

[verse]
Social threads unravel, stories untold,
Injustice painted bold, on every face, so cold.
We rise from the ashes, with dreams to be sold,
A testament to time, as legends unfold.

[bridge]
Echoes of the past, in every heartbeat,
Rhythms intertwine, where souls meet.
Keep your head held high, though skies may seem gray,
For every drop of rain, brings a brighter day.
