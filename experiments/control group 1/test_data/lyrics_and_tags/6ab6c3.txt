Lyrics :
[verse]
Waking up to the sound of static rain
Another day in this monochrome pain
Torn-up posters on my wall
Shadows dance, they never fall

[chorus]
I'm screaming out but I'm muted inside
Can't find my way through this endless night
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
I'm losing myself but I don't know why

[verse]
Walking down these streets of broken dreams
Neon lights reflect off puddles and streams
The world is heavy, it weighs me down
In this theater of lost clowns

[chorus]
I'm screaming out but I'm muted inside
Can't find my way through this endless night
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
I'm losing myself but I don't know why

[bridge]
Turn it up, let the music collide
Feel the rush, like an electric tide
It's a rebel's hymn, it's our battle cry
Together we stand or together we die

[chorus]
I'm screaming out but I'm muted inside
Can't find my way through this endless night
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
I'm losing myself but I don't know why

[outro]
Fade to black, let the echoes remain
Whispers of hope in the pouring rain
Tomorrow comes, will I face the fight?
Or just keep running through this endless night
