Hello, song generating agent! I'm looking to create a rock song inspired by British music from the 80s or 90s. The chorus should convey a message of happiness and contentment, with lyrics along the lines of: 

"You must be happy. You must be happy. You must be happy in this woooooorld."

Could you generate a song with these features for me? Thank you!
