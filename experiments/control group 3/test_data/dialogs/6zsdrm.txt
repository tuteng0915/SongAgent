Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre and the main theme of the song. How about we go with a soft rock ballad that captures a sense of longing and emotional intensity? Does that sound right to you?
Agent : 
That sounds like a great start! To ensure we're on the same page, let's break it down further. For the soft rock ballad with a sense of longing and emotional intensity, I would suggest the following tags: "soft rock", "ballad", "emotional", "longing", "melancholic". 

Now, let's think about the lyrics. Since we are aiming for emotional depth, we might want to include sections that convey personal experiences or feelings. Here’s a basic structure to get us started:

[Verse]
In the quiet of the night, I hear your voice
Whispering softly, making me rejoice

[Chorus]
Longing for you, under the moon so blue
Every moment, every breath, my heart beats for you

[Bridge]
The stars above, they guide me to where you are
In this journey, you’re my guiding star

Does this structure resonate with what you have in mind? We can certainly adjust the lyrics as needed to better fit the theme or your preferences. Once we finalize the details, remember to press the "generate" button to create the song.

The structure and lyrics you've proposed are quite fitting for the theme we're aiming for. I do have a request, though—could we possibly incorporate a line in the chorus that's drawn out, like "Don't let me goooooooo"? It adds to the dramatic effect we're seeking. Once that's settled, I think we'll be ready to generate the song. What do you think?

I've updated the chorus to include the drawn-out line "Don't let me goooooooo" for that added dramatic effect. Here's how our lyrics look now:

[Verse]
In the quiet of the night, I hear your voice
Whispering softly, making me rejoice

[Chorus]
Longing for you, under the moon so blue
Every moment, every breath, my heart beats for you
Don't let me goooooooo

[Bridge]
The stars above, they guide me to where you are
In this journey, you’re my guiding star
