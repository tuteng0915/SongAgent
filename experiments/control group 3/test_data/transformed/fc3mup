Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate an alternative genre song that captures the essence of a noir-style music video with vivid scenes and stage props. The song should tell the story of a man navigating through a city, encountering various predicaments. Key scenes from the video include the man falling into a spider web but managing to escape, ending up in a hospital where the nurse turns out to be malevolent, prompting him to create makeshift wings from cardboard and 'fly' out of the window.

The song was likely released in the early 2000s and aired on MTV around the same time as Greenday's "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." The lyrics may include a line similar to "Everything goes on and on and on and I..."

Please generate the lyrics and any relevant tags for this song.
