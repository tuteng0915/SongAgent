Lyrics :
[verse]
We're painting the town in primary hues,
Red, yellow, and blue, there's nothing we can't do.
With every step, a brushstroke of fun,
Together we dance under the neon sun.

[chorus]
Oh, let's get colorful, it's you and me,
In this dance of life, as free as can be.
With music that lifts us high above,
We'll keep on dancing with all our love.

[verse]
A kaleidoscope world, where dreams come alive,
Feel the rhythm take hold, let your spirit dive.
Through streets wide and narrow, our hearts beat as one,
Chasing horizons till the morning comes.

[chorus]
Oh, let's get colorful, it's you and me,
In this dance of life, as free as can be.
With music that lifts us high above,
We'll keep on dancing with all our love.

[bridge]
Beneath the starlit sky so bright,
Our laughter echoes through the night.
Each color tells a story true,
Of friendships formed in vibrant hue.

[chorus]
Oh, let's get colorful, it's you and me,
In this dance of life, as free as can be.
With music that lifts us high above,
We'll keep on dancing with all our love.
