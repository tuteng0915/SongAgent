[Verse]
Walking down this lonely road
I hear my heartbeat, it's a heavy load
But I keep on moving, can't slow down
Got my sights set on higher ground

[Chorus]
I'm singing out loud, I'm feeling alive
With every step, I'm starting to thrive
This boy's got a beat, and he's here to stay
Rocking all night, till the break of day

[Bridge]
There's a fire burning deep inside
I won't back down, I'll take that ride
Through the storm, I'll find my way
With this rock 'n roll, every single day
