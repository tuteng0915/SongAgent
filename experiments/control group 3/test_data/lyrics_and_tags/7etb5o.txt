Lyrics :
[verse]
Shadows stretch long on the ground
Memories echo, a silent sound
[chorus]
Lost in the void where you used to be
A ghost of the past, haunting me endlessly
[bridge]
Through the haze of time and despair
Your fleeting whispers linger in the air
[chorus]
Lost in the void where you used to be
A ghost of the past, haunting me endlessly
