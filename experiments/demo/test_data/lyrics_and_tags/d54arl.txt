Lyrics :
[verse]
Driving alone under the starlit sky
Memories flood back, I don't know why
Young love once so vivid, now bittersweet
In the silence, I hear our old heartbeat

[chorus]
Growing up, we learn to let go
But some loves linger, like a soft glow
I look back now, wiser but still
Holding onto pieces of us that time won't kill

[verse]
Every curve in the road, every stoplight's glow
Reminds me of lessons I've come to know
Love fades, dreams change, yet here I stand
Grateful for those moments, they shaped who I am

[chorus]
Growing up, we learn to let go
But some loves linger, like a soft glow
I look back now, wiser but still
Holding onto pieces of us that time won't kill

[bridge]
In this quiet night, reflection finds me
The past and present collide so seamlessly
I've grown, I've loved, I've lost, but I'm whole
And though you're gone, your mark is my soul
