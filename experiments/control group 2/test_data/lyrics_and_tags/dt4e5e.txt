Lyrics :
[Male Verse]
In this old house of creaking wood
Where shadows dance as they always should
A rocking chair that sways alone
Beneath the beams where love has grown

[Female Chorus]
But there's no more warmth in this place
No gentle touch, no warm embrace
The trees have witnessed our despair
And carried off the dreams we shared

[Male Bridge]
Once vibrant hues turned grey with time
Faded like a once loved rhyme
Amongst the ashes, whispers stay
Of what we had before the blaze

[Female Verse]
You linger here amidst decay
Where memories turn to dust each day
Find solace now beyond these walls
For nothing lives where silence calls

[Male Chorus]
Yet still I see those branches high
That scrape the sky with a mournful cry
They hold the secrets of our past
When seasons change, they won't last

[Female Bridge]
Let go of sorrow's heavy chains
Release the pain, let hope remain
Through empty halls and broken panes
The forest calls, its freedom gains

[Outro - Male & Female]
Together we'll walk through the trees
Leaving behind this ghostly freeze
With every step away from home
We find new roots where none have grown
