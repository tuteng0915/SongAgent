I want a song that feels nostalgic, with a raspy voice and simple guitar sounds. Can we start with that?

Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I understand your preferences correctly, could you specify what kind of nostalgic feeling you're aiming for? For example, is it related to a specific era or memory? Also, do you have any preference for the theme or story within the song? 

Once I have more details, I'll generate the tags and lyrics for your song.
User : 
It should feel like the early 2000s, very folksy. The lyrics could mention Cuba or Che Guevara somehow.

I've set the parameters for your song to capture that early 2000s folksy nostalgia with a Cuban theme, featuring Che Guevara. Here are the lyrics I've drafted:

```
[verse]
In the streets of Havana, echoes linger on,
Stories of a legend, Che, who's come and gone.
With a raspy whisper, tales begin to unfold,
Of revolution's fire, in hearts both young and old.

[chorus]
The strum of a guitar, beneath the Cuban moon,
A raspy voice sings songs, where heroes once stood tall.
Nostalgia in the air, as memories rewind,
To days of hope and dreams, in every corner of your mind.

[verse]
Through the alleys of time, where shadows gently play,
Che's spirit lingers, in each guitar's soft sway.
Voices blend with night's breeze, carrying dreams afar,
On wings of freedom's promise, like notes upon a star.
```

The lyrics are great, but can we add something about guns and sugar cane fields? Maybe playing or lying in them?

I've updated the lyrics to include a reference to guns and sugar cane fields, adding a new bridge section:

```
[bridge]
Lying in the sugar cane fields, under the sun so bright,
Guns resting beside us, as we dream through the night.
Revolution's children, playing where the whispers dwell,
In the heart of Cuba's soul, where stories never fell.
```
