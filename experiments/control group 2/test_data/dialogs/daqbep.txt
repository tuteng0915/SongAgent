Hey there! I'd like you to generate a song that matches the following description: It's a hip-hop/R&B track with a slightly upbeat rhythm, performed by a male artist with a Jamaican or Haitian accent. The vibe should be romantic but not overly intense—think less Boyz II Men and more laid-back beach vibes. Picture a scene where the beach meets the tree line close to the shoreline. Oh, and it has that one-hit wonder feel to it. Can you create something like this?

I've crafted a song that matches your description—a hip-hop/R&B track with an upbeat rhythm, romantic beach vibes, and the feel of a one-hit wonder. It features a male artist with a Jamaican accent.

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
Walking down the shoreline, feeling so alive,
The sun's setting and it's bringing me vibes,
Your silhouette against the evening sky,
I can't help but think I'd like to get high.

[chorus]
This love is like a summer breeze,
A little bit of sweetness, just as much as I need,
No rush, no stress, just you and me,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the sand and sea.

[verse]
Underneath the palm trees, where shadows play,
I'm lost in your eyes, girl, every single day,
You're my island queen, my paradise dream,
Together we'll float on this ocean stream.

[chorus]
This love is like a summer breeze,
A little bit of sweetness, just as much as I need,
No rush, no stress, just you and me,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the sand and sea.

[bridge]
Let's take it slow, let the night unfold,
In this moment, our story told,
With the stars above and the waves below,
We'll create a memory that will forever glow.
