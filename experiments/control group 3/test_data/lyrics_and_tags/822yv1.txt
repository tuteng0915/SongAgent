Lyrics :
[verse]
Rain whispers on my window pane
Stories of a world bathed in gentle pain
Clouds gather, skies gray and vast
Nature's lullaby, a moment to contrast

[chorus]
Drops fall softly, like dreams from the sky
A dance with the rain, where worries lie
In every splash, a tale untold
Of peace and reflection, pure as gold

[verse]
Each droplet a mirror, reflecting the day
Thoughts wander and waver, carried away
Time slows down, in this tranquil embrace
Finding solace within, a serene space

[bridge]
And if the storm should come
I'll find shelter in its song
For even in chaos, beauty lies
In the rhythm of the rain, I realize

[chorus]
Drops fall softly, like dreams from the sky
A dance with the rain, where worries lie
In every splash, a tale untold
Of peace and reflection, pure as gold
