Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that matches some specific vibes I have in mind. Here's what I'm thinking:  

- **Style**: A 60s-inspired sound with a raw, minimalist feel—no heavy background instrumentation like modern tracks.  
- **Vocals**: Either a female singer or a high-pitched male vocalist.  
- **Mood/Tone**: Cowboy-like, with a marching snare drum adding a rugged rhythm to the mix.  
- **Genre**: Not a ballad (definitely not "Ballad of the Green Berets"), but something more stripped-down and evocative.  

Think you can whip up something based on this? Let’s create it!
