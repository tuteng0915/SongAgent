Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadow of the static frame
We dance to the rhythm of the rain
A monochrome waltz in the streetlights' glow
Every heartbeat echoes, soft and low

[chorus]
Oh, we're fading to gray
In this indie ballet
Where the nights never end
And the colors never blend

[verse]
Underneath the silver skies
We find our dreams in disguise
The city's a canvas painted in hues
Of charcoal whispers and midnight blues

[chorus]
Oh, we're fading to gray
In this indie ballet
Where the nights never end
And the colors never blend

[bridge]
The world is a film in black and white
Projected on the walls of our nights
With every strum, with every beat
Our souls entwine in this muted retreat

[chorus]
Oh, we're fading to gray
In this indie ballet
Where the nights never end
And the colors never blend
