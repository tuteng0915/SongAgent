I need more details about the theme or story of the song. What is it mainly about? Love, adventure, heartbreak?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To better tailor the song to your preferences, could you please share what kind of themes or stories you're interested in? For example, do you prefer a narrative about love, adventure, heartbreak, or something else entirely?

Let's get some inspiration flowing. Here are a few options:
- A romantic ballad about finding true love against all odds.
- An adventurous tale of exploring unknown lands and discovering oneself.
- A poignant story of heartbreak and healing.

Please let me know which direction you'd like to go in, or feel free to suggest another idea!
