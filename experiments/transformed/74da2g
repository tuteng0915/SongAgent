Hey there, song generating agent! I have a fun challenge for you. I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of the roaring twenties, with a lively Charleston vibe right from the start. But here's the twist: as the song progresses, it should smoothly transition into a hip-hop style beat. Imagine a female voice leading the track, accompanied by some playful "bop bop" noises sprinkled throughout.

To give you a better idea, think along the lines of "A Little Party Never Killed Nobody," which beautifully blends a 20's sound with a modern touch. Can you create something similar? Let's get this musical journey started!
