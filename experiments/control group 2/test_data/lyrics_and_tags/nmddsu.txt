Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, it's a sunny day, let's go out and play,
With a funky rhythm that we can all sway,
To the tune of F F D, yeah, that's the way,
F C D in the mix, come on, let's slay.

[chorus]
It's the melody we love, it's the sound of fun,
With a touch of the past, like an old number one,
In this hip hop jam, you'll find your stride,
Kids' voices joining in, side by side.

[bridge]
The beat goes on, it never stops,
Rapping with the kids, around the clock,
We're making music, let's make it tight,
Old-school vibes with a future bright.

[chorus]
It's the melody we love, it's the sound of fun,
With a touch of the past, like an old number one,
In this hip hop jam, you'll find your stride,
Kids' voices joining in, side by side.
