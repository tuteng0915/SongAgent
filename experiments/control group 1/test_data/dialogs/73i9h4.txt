Sure thing! Let's start by nailing down a catchy title for this punk Oktoberfest anthem about Rosie. Got any ideas for the title?

Sure, here are a few title ideas for your punk Oktoberfest anthem about Rosie:

1. "Rosie's Rebellion"
2. "Oktoberfest Ode to Rosie"
3. "Punk Polka for Rosie"
4. "Rosie, The Brewmaster's Queen"
5. "Raise a Stein for Rosie"

Which one do you like the most, or would you like to mix elements from different options? Once we have the title, we can move on to setting the tags and lyrics.
