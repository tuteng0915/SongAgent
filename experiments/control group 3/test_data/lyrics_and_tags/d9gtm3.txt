Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
In the quiet of the night, you trace the stars
With every heartbeat, you're reaching far
I know you're a dreamer, lost in your mind
Chasing horizons that you may never find

[Chorus]
But now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose
In the silence, there's only truth
Let the echoes of your dreams be your muse
Now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose

[Verse 2]
The city sleeps as shadows grow
Every step is a story, every breath a glow
Dreams are fading but you hold on tight
To whispers of hope beneath the pale moonlight

[Chorus]
But now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose
In the silence, there's only truth
Let the echoes of your dreams be your muse
Now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
Hold on to the visions you can't let go
They're the colors before the dawn
Even when the world feels cold
Your spirit will carry on

[Chorus]
'Cause now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose
In the silence, there's only truth
Let the echoes of your dreams be your muse
Now you've got nothing, nothing left to lose
