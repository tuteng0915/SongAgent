Hey, song agent! I need your help to generate a song that captures the essence of what I’m looking for. The song should have a pounding drumbeat reminiscent of Arctic Monkeys’ “Do I Wanna Know,” but with an 80s vibe in terms of production—think big synthesizers, electric guitars, and a powerful, anthemic sound. It should also feature rich vocal harmonies with noticeable echo effects, giving it a polished boyband feel. If possible, include a key change towards the end to add a dramatic finish. Can you create something based on these ideas?
