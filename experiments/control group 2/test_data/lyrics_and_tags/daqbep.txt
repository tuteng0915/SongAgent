Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the shoreline, feeling so alive,
The sun's setting and it's bringing me vibes,
Your silhouette against the evening sky,
I can't help but think I'd like to get high.

[chorus]
This love is like a summer breeze,
A little bit of sweetness, just as much as I need,
No rush, no stress, just you and me,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the sand and sea.

[verse]
Underneath the palm trees, where shadows play,
I'm lost in your eyes, girl, every single day,
You're my island queen, my paradise dream,
Together we'll float on this ocean stream.

[chorus]
This love is like a summer breeze,
A little bit of sweetness, just as much as I need,
No rush, no stress, just you and me,
We'll dance to the rhythm of the sand and sea.

[bridge]
Let's take it slow, let the night unfold,
In this moment, our story told,
With the stars above and the waves below,
We'll create a memory that will forever glow.
