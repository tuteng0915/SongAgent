Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a song that fits this description: it should have a 70s-80s rock vibe, featuring an instrument that sounds like a fairground organ or accordion. The tone of the song should be neutral—not too sad, but not overly happy either. It should feel repetitive and hypnotic in its structure. The singer should be male, with a youthful voice, sounding like he’s in his 20s or early 30s. Let’s create something unique based on these features!

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
In the heart of the carousel night
Where shadows dance under electric light
I see your face in a neon glow
Lost in the rhythm, let the music flow

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[verse]
Underneath the painted sky
A melody calls as the moments fly
Faded stars and spinning wheels
Holding on to what the night reveals

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[bridge]
The organ plays a haunting tune
Like whispers carried by the moon
Step closer, don't be afraid
This carnival never truly fades

[chorus]
Round and round we go, chasing echoes of time
The wheels spin faster, caught in a rhyme
No beginning, no end, just the sound of our dreams
We're riding the circle, lost in the seams

[outro]
As the night begins to fade
The music lingers, a serenade
Of all we've found and all we've lost
Within this endless carousel's frost
