Hello, song generating agent! I have a unique request for you. I'd like you to generate a song that captures the essence of a track I vaguely remember. Here are the details:

- The song should have an atmospheric, almost ethereal quality, with a focus on vocals akin to an a capella style, complemented by subtle background music.
- It should be performed from the perspective of a female singer.
- The title must include the word "Rain," and it would be great if it could evoke a similar feeling to Joni Mitchell's work.
- Keep the duration relatively short, ideally under three minutes.

Could you create something based on these guidelines? Thank you! :)
