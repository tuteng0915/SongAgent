Sure, I can help with that. To start, could you tell me more about the overall mood or emotion you'd like the song to convey?
Agent : 
Sure! Let's dive into some specifics. Could you describe the mood or emotion you're aiming for? For instance, do you want it to be uplifting and energetic, or perhaps more introspective and mellow? Additionally, any themes or specific topics you'd like the lyrics to cover would be helpful.
User : 
I think the song should feel introspective and a bit melancholic, but with a sense of hope. As for themes, focus on personal struggles and acceptance. Can we also include a theme about friendship among these outcasts?

Great, I have a clearer picture now. Before we proceed to generate the lyrics and tags, let's confirm your preferences.

I'll set the mood to be introspective and melancholic with a sense of hope. The themes will include personal struggles, acceptance, and friendship among outcasts. 

Does this sound right to you? If so, I'll go ahead and generate the initial tags and lyrics for the song.

[verse]
In the quiet corners of my mind,
Where shadows dance and time stands still,
I find myself amidst the pain,
Of battles fought and dreams that never came.

[chorus]
But there's a light, a flicker in the dark,
A gentle whisper, igniting a spark,
Together we stand, hand in hand,
Outcasts united, breaking through the sand.

[verse]
Through the cracks of broken promises,
We forge our path, a bond unyielding,
Our scars tell stories words can't express,
In this journey of self-discovery and healing.

[bridge]
And though the world may turn its back,
On those who stray from the beaten track,
We'll raise our voices, loud and clear,
For friendship's strength will conquer fear.

[chorus]
There's a light, a beacon in the night,
Guiding us forward, making wrongs right,
Together we rise, with hearts so bold,
Outcasts no more, our story told.
```

The lyrics and tags look great, but I think we should include a verse about the boy who is unsure of his gender identity. Can you add that in?

[verse]
There's a boy who stands with questioning eyes,
Unsure of who he is, what his heart implies,
In a world that asks him to fit in,
He finds solace in love, lets the truth begin.

And though the world may turn its back,
On those who stray from the beaten track,
We'll raise our voices, loud and clear,
For friendship's strength will conquer fear.
