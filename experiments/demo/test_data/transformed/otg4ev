Hello, song agent! I'd like you to generate a song based on a concept I recently came across. The song should be cheerful on the surface but have a deeper, more somber meaning. It should be about a woman who has lost her husband and is talking to him. The lyrics should leave it ambiguous whether she's truly communicating with him or if she's descending into madness. Can you create something that captures this bittersweet sentiment?
