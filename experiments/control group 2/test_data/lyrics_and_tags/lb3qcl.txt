Lyrics :
[verse]
Waking up to the sound of rain
Tracing patterns on the window pane
Memories like whispers call my name
In this small and quiet town

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[verse]
Pages turn like leaves in the wind
Every story fades but never ends
I walk these streets, a silent friend
Underneath the gray and watching skies

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[bridge]
And if I could, I'd hold on tight
To moments lost in fading light
But time moves on; it won't be kind
We leave our ghosts behind

[chorus]
Oh, the days slip by so slow
With a melody that only I know
Strings of sorrow softly glow
In the echo of where we used to go

[outro]
The violin weeps as the night grows deep
A tapestry woven in shades of sleep
Tomorrow waits, but here I keep
The echoes of dreams that never truly leap
