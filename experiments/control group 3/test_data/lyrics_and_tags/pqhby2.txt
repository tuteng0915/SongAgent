Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of winter's embrace,
A lone wolf howls, lost in space.
Snowflakes fall, silent and cold,
Solitude's tale, never told.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.

[verse]
Contrasts collide in frosty air,
Shadows dance without a care.
Whispers of warmth in icy veins,
A fleeting moment, love remains.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.

[bridge]
The calm before the storm arrives,
Silent whispers break the ties.
Explosions echo through the night,
As dawn breaks, we stand united.

[chorus]
Rise from the ashes, soar so high,
Beneath the stormy sky.
Feel the thunder, hear the cry,
Of battles we cannot deny.
