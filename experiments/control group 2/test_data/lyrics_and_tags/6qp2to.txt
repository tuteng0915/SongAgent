Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows she creeps, silent steps in the night,
With a heart full of dreams and a soul full of fight.
Her eyes set on him, her compass, her guide,
Little did she know, the pain that would collide.

[chorus]
Oh, the world may break us, but we rise,
From the ashes of love, where the fire lies.
Betrayed by fate, yet here I stand,
Stronger than before, in this promised land.

[verse]
Tears fall like rain, washing away the past,
The mirror reflects a woman, reborn at last.
She walks the streets alone, yet not truly apart,
For her strength is her own, a beat in her heart.

[bridge]
No longer chasing shadows, no chains to hold,
In the silence she finds her story untold.
A silhouette against the world, stark and free,
In black and white, she found her destiny.

[chorus]
Oh, the world may break us, but we rise,
From the ashes of love, where the fire lies.
Betrayed by fate, yet here I stand,
Stronger than before, in this promised land.
