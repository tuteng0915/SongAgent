Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the morning light
Mom, my thoughts drift to you and sis tonight
Every word unsaid, every promise made
Lingers like the morning dew

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

[verse]
Walking down these streets we used to know
Each corner holds a memory or two
The laughter, the tears, the moments so dear
Are etched forever in everything we do

[chorus]
We're chasing dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

[bridge]
And if the world falls apart
And if the stars lose their shine
I'll be here by your side
With every breath, with all my time

[chorus]
Mom, sis, we've chased dreams in the endless night
Holding onto love, holding on tight
Through the highs and lows, through the wrongs and rights
Our hearts beat as one under the starlit sky

[outro]
Together we stand, hand in hand
Underneath this starlit sky
Forever strong, forever true
This song is for me, mom, and sis too
