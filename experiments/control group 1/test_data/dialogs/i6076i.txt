User : 
I want a rock/pop song about unrequited love, with a tempo that's not too fast or slow. The guy is stuck in the friendzone, and the girl is oblivious to his feelings. Can you generate some lyrics for this?

I've created a set of lyrics and tags for your rock/pop song about unrequited love, capturing the essence of being stuck in the friendzone while the other person remains oblivious to deeper feelings. The tempo is moderate, not too fast or slow, as you requested. Here are the sections of the lyrics:

[verse]
I've been standing here for too long
Hiding my feelings, playing along
You smile and it cuts like a knife
We're dancing on the edge of what might've been

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[verse]
Every laugh we share is bittersweet
Every casual touch sends chills down my spine
But you're oblivious to the signs I show
I guess some things are better left unsaid

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[bridge]
If only I could turn back time
Erase these feelings, make you mine
But I know that dreams don't come true
When you're living half a life with you

[chorus]
Stuck in the friendzone, can't break free
Wanting more than you'll ever see
I'm just a shadow in your sunny sky
A love that's doomed to pass you by

[outro]
So here's to us, and all we'll never be
Forever friends, but never meant to be

The tags suggest a blend of rock and pop elements with emotional and heartfelt undertones suitable for this theme.
