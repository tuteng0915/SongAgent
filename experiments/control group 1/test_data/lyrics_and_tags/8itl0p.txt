Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been down this road for far too long
Walking in shadows, where the lights don't belong
But tonight, I'll break these chains that bind
Feel the rush, leave the past behind

[chorus]
Break it down, let the walls come crashing in
Dubstep drops, feel the bass within
We're rising up, like a phoenix from the flame
In this moment, we are not the same

[verse]
Every heartbeat's a step towards the unknown
With every breath, I'm claiming what's my own
The rhythm of rebellion, it's in my soul
Together we stand, and together we'll roll

[chorus]
Break it down, let the walls come crashing in
Dubstep drops, feel the bass within
We're rising up, like a phoenix from the flame
In this moment, we are not the same

[bridge]
The night is ours, we'll light it up like fire
Basslines pounding, taking us higher
This is our time, we'll make it to the top
With rock and dubstep, we never ever stop

[chorus]
Break it down, let the walls come crashing in
Dubstep drops, feel the bass within
We're rising up, like a phoenix from the flame
In this moment, we are not the same
