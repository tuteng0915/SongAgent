Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches some specific details. Here's what I'm looking for:

I want an alt-rock song with a really unique and trippy vibe, something that could have been made in the early 2000s. The lyrics should evoke imagery of a Victorian-style character, maybe someone eccentric or mysterious, surrounded by surreal floating objectsâ€”perhaps sheep or other whimsical things. The overall mood should feel dreamlike, slightly weird, but still captivating.

Can you create something based on this concept?

[verse]  
In the haze of a dreamworld night  
Floats an oddity dressed in black and white  
A top hat perched upon his head  
As he wanders through this realm widespread  

[chorus]  
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above  
Carried by whispers of another love  
In this strange parade of curiosities  
We drift along on endless seas  

[verse]  
Candelabras light the velvet air  
Their glow reflected everywhere  
The man with eyes that pierce the soul  
Commands the dance of each wandering goal  

[chorus]  
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above  
Carried by whispers of another love  
In this strange parade of curiosities  
We drift along on endless seas  

[bridge]  
Through the looking glass we go  
To lands where only dreamers know  
With every step, reality bends  
And leads us back to where it ends  

[chorus]  
Oh, the sheep they float like clouds above  
Carried by whispers of another love  
In this strange parade of curiosities  
We drift along on endless seas  

[outro]  
So if you see him, tip your hat  
To the master of this dreamscape flat  
Where time stands still and visions play  
Amongst the flock that lost its way
