Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadow of the skyline
Where the streetlights hum with secrets untold
We walk together, hearts adrift
On boulevards where dreams grow old

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[verse]
Concrete towers whisper warnings
Of the reckoning that draws near
Skyscrapers stand like ancient sentinels
Guarding memories we hold dear

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[bridge]
The countdown echoes through the night
Each chime a reminder of our fleeting time
But in these streets, love will ignite
A spark that outlasts the end of rhyme

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[outro]
And when the last bell tolls its knell
Our love story in stars will dwell
