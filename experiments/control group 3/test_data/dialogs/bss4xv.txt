I need you to generate a song in the indie rock or emo rock style, with heartfelt and raw lyrics. The song should be from the perspective of a boyfriend recounting his girlfriend's final words after a tragic accident. What specific emotions do you want the song to convey?
Agent : 
Thank you for providing the style and theme of the song. To better capture the emotions in the lyrics, could you please specify the primary feelings you'd like to convey? For instance, is there a sense of love, loss, regret, or perhaps a mix of these and other emotions that you want to be present throughout the song? This will greatly help in crafting lyrics that resonate with the intended emotional impact.
User : 
The main feelings I want are sorrow, guilt, and a deep sense of loss. Can you add some poetic lines about the rain and the flashing lights?

 [verse]
In the rain, she slipped away
Her voice, a whisper against the pain
'Hold me close,' she softly said
As flashing lights danced on her face instead

[chorus]
The guilt that I bear, like shadows in the air
I couldn't save her, my love, my only care
With every drop of rain, I feel the stain
Of words unspoken, now forever forsaken

[verse]
Each word a beacon in the darkened skies
A fleeting moment as life bids goodbye
I reach for her hand, but it fades to mist
The sound of sirens, dreams amiss

[bridge]
And if I could turn back time
To rewrite our stars, realign
I'd brave any storm, face any fight
To hear once more 'I love you,' under the moonlight

[chorus]
The guilt that I bear, like shadows in the air
I couldn't save her, my love, my only care
With every drop of rain, I feel the stain
Of words unspoken, now forever forsaken
