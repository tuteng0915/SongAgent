I want a song that's smooth and has a nice guitar sound. It should be emotional and have some specific phrases included. Can you start working on that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. To make sure I understand your preferences correctly, could you please specify the phrases you'd like included in the song? Also, when you say 'smooth' and 'emotional', do you lean towards a particular genre or style such as blues, jazz, or perhaps something else?

Let's also determine your general music preference to ensure we align with your tastes.

It seems I don't have your specific preferences on file yet. Could you provide some guidance on the genre or style you prefer? For instance, do you enjoy the sound of blues, jazz, acoustic, or another style? Additionally, please share the phrases you'd like included in the song so we can incorporate them effectively. 

Once I have this information, I'll be able to craft a song that better suits your vision.
User : 
I'd like the song to include the phrases "I can't believe it," "can you feel it," "ohhhh but I —-" and "in the world to realize." For the style, think along the lines of what Marc Anthony might sing if he were singing in English. Does that help?

I've crafted a song with a smooth and emotional tone, featuring nice guitar sounds inspired by the style of Marc Anthony. The lyrics include the phrases you specified: "I can't believe it," "can you feel it," "ohhhh but I —-", and "in the world to realize."

Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
I can't believe it
In the quiet moments I find myself saying
Can you feel it
A gentle whisper in the night

[chorus]
Ohhhh but I —-
Search for meaning in the world to realize
That love is all we need
To heal and to grow

[bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight
We find our way, into the light
With every heartbeat, with every sigh
Together we'll soar, together we'll fly
