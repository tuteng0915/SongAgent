"I want to generate an upbeat 90s-inspired rock/pop song. The track should start with a male voice repeating 'yeahs,' followed by a switch to a female singer for the main verses." Can you also add some details about the theme or topic of the lyrics?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Since you're looking for an upbeat 90s-inspired rock/pop song, let's focus on a theme of youthful rebellion and freedom, which was quite prevalent in the 90s music scene. The lyrics could tell the story of breaking free from societal expectations and embracing one's true self.

Let me summarize what we've discussed so far:
- **Genre/Style:** Upbeat 90s-inspired rock/pop
- **Vocals:** Male voice repeating 'yeahs' at the start, then switching to a female singer for the main verses.
- **Theme/Topic:** Youthful rebellion and freedom

Now, let's set some tags and draft the initial lyrics for the song.

### Tags:
- Upbeat, 90s Rock, Pop Rock, Youthful Rebellion, Freedom, Male Vocals, Female Vocals

### Lyrics:
```
[intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[verse 1 - Female]
Walking down these city streets
Feeling the pulse, feeling the beat
They told me to conform, to play it safe and sound
But I'm breaking out, I won't be bound

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is my time, my revolution's here

[verse 2 - Female]
Painting the town in colors so bright
Dancing through the night, under neon lights
Their rules don't define me, I write my own page
In this world of dreams, I'm setting the stage

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is my time, my revolution's here

[bridge - Female]
Every heartbeat, every breath I take
I'm carving paths no one else will make
Together we rise, together we'll fall
We're the dreamers, answering the call

[chorus - Female]
Free as the wind, wild as the sea
I'll live my life just how I wanna be
No chains to hold me, no shadows to fear
This is our time, our revolution's here

[outro - Female]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
```
