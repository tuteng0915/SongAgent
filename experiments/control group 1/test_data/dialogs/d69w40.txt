I've set the tags and lyrics for your piano-based interlude song featuring a dialogue about cultivating meaning in life, likened to roses. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
In the garden of life, we toil and sow
Cultivating dreams in the soil below

[chorus]
Oh, roses of meaning, bloom so bright
Through trials and shadows, find your light

[verse]
Each petal a story, each thorn a test
In the heart of the rose, we find our rest

[bridge]
Life and meaning entwined, like roots deep in clay
Nurture the flower that blooms today
