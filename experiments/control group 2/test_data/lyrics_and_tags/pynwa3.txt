Lyrics :
[verse]
I woke up today, you were gone
Just like that, our love withdrawn
The silence screams, it cuts so deep
In this cold bed, where dreams sleep

[chorus]
You left without a word or sound
Leaving me lost, in this abyss profound
Every memory, a knife to my soul
In this endless night, I'm not whole

[verse]
Walking these streets we used to roam
Nowhere feels like home, I'm alone
Each shadow whispers your name
In the echoes of my pain and shame

[bridge]
Time moves on, but I stand still
Yearning for your touch, against my will
Every face I see, every voice I hear
Brings me back to when you were near

[chorus]
You left without a word or sound
Leaving me lost, in this abyss profound
Every memory, a knife to my soul
In this endless night, I'm not whole

[twist]
I thought I saw you the other day, dad
In the crowd, just a fleeting glance
But it wasn't you, just another man
Yet in that moment, I understood

[ending]
This heartache's not just from losing you
But realizing who I've become too
A shadow of the love we once knew
Longing for what was, and what could never be true
