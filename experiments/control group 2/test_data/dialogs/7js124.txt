User : 
Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song for me. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should have some piano in it and be fast-paced. The main singer should sound a bit like Kenny Loggins, and there should be background singers adding harmony. The hook of the song should go something like "C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon, C’mon in love."  

Can you create that for me?

I've set up your song with the following:

- **Tags**: piano, fast-paced, Kenny Loggins, harmony, hook
- **Lyrics**:
  ```
  [verse]
  Life's a highway, I'm riding it all night long
  Got the pedal to the metal, moving strong

  [chorus]
  C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon in love
  Feel the rhythm, let's groove from above

  [bridge]
  We can dance under the stars tonight
  Let the music take us to new heights

  [chorus]
  C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon in love
  Feel the rhythm, let's groove from above
  ```
