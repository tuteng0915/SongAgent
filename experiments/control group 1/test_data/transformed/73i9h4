Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on some specific requirements. Here's what I'm looking for:

I want to create a punk song that captures the energy of Oktoberfest 2010 in Munich. The theme should revolve around a cheating girl named Rosie. Despite the betrayal, the song should be upbeat and party-like, reminiscent of a big hit in Germany from a few decades back.

Can you generate something like that for me?
