Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a song for me that captures the essence of the 80s with its synth-driven verses, evoking a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. As we move into the chorus, I want the singer to really belt out the words "I can feeeel you" in a voice reminiscent of Kenny Loggins when he sang Danger Zone â€“ perhaps a bit hoarser to add an edge. The song should be a rock anthem, done in the new wave style, similar to the Top Gun soundtrack's energetic and powerful vibe. Can you generate this song for me?
