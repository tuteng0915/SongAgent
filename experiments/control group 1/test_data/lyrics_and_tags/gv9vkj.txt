Lyrics :
[verse]
Wading through the shadows, where the night whispers my name,
beneath electric skies, in a world no longer tame.

[chorus]
Feel the pulse, it's guiding me astray,
in this synthetic dream, where reality fades away.

[bridge]
Basslines echo deep, as echoes softly collide,
minimal beats hold the secrets where we hide.
