Lyrics :
[verse]
In the static of the night, whispers call
From the shadows of the ward, echoes fall
Voices lost in a spectral show
Dancing to the rhythm of an old radio

[chorus]
Tune in to the frequency of fear
Where spirits speak and haunt the air
Turn the dial, feel the chill so near
A presence lingers, you can't repair

[verse]
Behind these walls where secrets sleep
In the heart of darkness, silence keeps
Beneath the moon's cold, sterile glow
A mystery hums in the undertow

[chorus]
Tune in to the frequency of fear
Where spirits speak and haunt the air
Turn the dial, feel the chill so near
A presence lingers, you can't repair

[bridge]
The signal fades but never dies
Trapped between the living and lies
Electric dreams in limbo go
Haunting the halls through endless nights
