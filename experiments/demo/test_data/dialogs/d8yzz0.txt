I'd be happy to help with that! Let's start by focusing on the main theme of the song. Could you tell me more about what inspired the key lyric "gonna leave me here on my own"?
Agent : 
Sure! To create a song around the lyric "gonna leave me here on my own," it's important to understand the context and emotions you want to convey. Could you share more about the story or feelings behind this lyric? For example, is it about heartbreak, independence, or something else? This will help shape the tone and direction of the song.

It's more about feeling abandoned, like the world keeps spinning but I'm stuck in the same place. You know, that frustration when everyone else is moving on?

That's a powerful theme. To capture the essence of feeling abandoned and stuck while the world moves on, I propose we create a song with an emotional tone that reflects both frustration and a sense of longing. 

Before we proceed to draft some lyrics, let's consider your preferences for the musical style. Do you envision this song being more acoustic and somber, or would you prefer something with a stronger beat that mirrors the internal frustration? 

Once we have a clearer picture of your preferences, I'll generate the initial tags and lyrics for the song.
User : 
I think I'd like it punchy, with a strong beat—something that really matches the frustration. But also, you know, still got that raw pop punk edge to it.

Great! With the tags set to capture a pop punk style with emotional depth, frustration, and a strong beat, we can now focus on the lyrics. Here's a draft for the song:

[Verse]
Caught in the same old scene, shadows moving fast,
Everyone’s chasing dreams, but I’m stuck here, can’t last.
Clock keeps ticking on, but I'm frozen in time,
World spins madly on, leaving me behind.

[Chorus]
You’re gonna leave me here on my own,
In this place where I've grown so cold.
The silence screams louder than before,
As you slam the door and walk away, no more.

[Bridge]
Frustration builds like a fire in my soul,
Every step forward feels like losing control.
But maybe this standstill is where I find my way,
Or maybe I'll just watch as you fade to grey.
