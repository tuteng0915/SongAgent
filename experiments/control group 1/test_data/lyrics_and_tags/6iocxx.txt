Lyrics :
[verse]
Swaying to the rhythm of the night
Feel the beat, it's taking flight
In this moment, we're alive
Latin beats keeping us in stride

[chorus]
Dance like nobody's watching, feel the vibe
Let the music take you higher and higher
With every step, with every move we make
We're living in a Latin dream, no time to break

[verse]
Spinning under starlit skies
Lost within the melody that never dies
Our hearts beating as one tonight
Together we'll dance until the morning light

[chorus]
Dance like nobody's watching, feel the vibe
Let the music take you higher and higher
With every step, with every move we make
We're living in a Latin dream, no time to break

[bridge]
The night is ours, let's seize the chance
To live it up, caught in a passionate trance
Feel the fire burning deep inside
With Ricky's beat, thereâ€™s nowhere left to hide

[chorus]
Dance like nobody's watching, feel the vibe
Let the music take you higher and higher
With every step, with every move we make
We're living in a Latin dream, no time to break
