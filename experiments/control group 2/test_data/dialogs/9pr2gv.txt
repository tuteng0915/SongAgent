Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I'd like you to generate a song based on the following details: It should be in the pop genre with a moderately paced, groovy, and chill vibeâ€”something that feels catchy and fits well within a "Trap" influenced station. The singer should be female, and the chorus needs to include the lyrics "ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow" (feel free to adjust the number of 'owees' to make it flow better). Keep the overall tone engaging but laid-back, capturing that memorable and addictive quality. Let's create something that could easily be mistaken for a hit song I might hear during a workout!

    [verse]
    Walking through the night, feeling so alive
    Heartbeat in my chest, ready to survive
    City lights are shining, they light up my way
    Every step I take is a brand new day
    
    [chorus]
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow
    
    [verse]
    Underneath the stars, where dreams come to play
    Let the music guide us, we'll never fade away
    Feel the bassline pumping, it's taking control
    We'll keep moving forward, let it feed our soul
    
    [chorus]
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow
    
    [bridge]
    Tonight we own the city, our shadows cast
    With every heartbeat, memories amass
    In this moment forever, we'll stay
    Lost within the magic, till the break of day
    
    [chorus]
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Dancing through the silence, let the rhythm flow
    ooooh... owee owee owee owee in the sha-dow
    Feeling so electric, steal the night's glow
