Lyrics :
[intro]
Step right up, it's a grand old show,
Lights are flashing, don't be slow.
Colors spinning, laughter flows,
Underneath the big top, here we go!

[chorus]
Dance with clowns and fly with trapeze,
Magic fills the air with ease.
Cotton candy clouds above,
In this world where dreams are made of.

[verse]
Carousel spins tales to tell,
Mirrors maze where secrets dwell.
Every corner, a new surprise,
A symphony of joy beneath the skies.
