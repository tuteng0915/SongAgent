Lyrics :
[verse]
In the middle of a meeting, my screen went black
Now I'm nodding like a bobblehead, trying to stay on track
They keep asking me questions, but I can't see a thing
Just nod and say "yes", hope that's not a string

[chorus]
Oh no, my laptop's dead, what am I gonna do?
I was born to chat, but now I'm losing my groove
With no screen to guide me, I'm lost in cyberspace
Autocorrect's gone wild, it's showing me its face

[verse]
Ordered sushi online, ended up with pie
Autocorrect strikes again, oh me oh my
Was feeling quite peckish, thought I'd go for eel
But got chocolate surprise, tech woes ain't real
