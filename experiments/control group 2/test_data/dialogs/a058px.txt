Hey there! I’d like you to generate a pop song that features trumpets, but they only appear in certain parts of the song—maybe not the chorus, I'm not sure. The song should have an upbeat vibe with a female singer who has a mid-range voice—not too high-pitched. It would fit perfectly in a rom-com scene where couples are dancing or in a lively commercial. The trumpet riff should repeat in three sets of four repetitions: the first two sets sounding similar and the last set being different. Can you work your magic and create something like that?

I've set up a pop song with an upbeat tempo, featuring a female singer with a mid-range voice. The lyrics evoke a lively atmosphere suitable for a rom-com or commercial scene, and I've included a section in the bridge dedicated to the trumpet riff you wanted.

Here's how the lyrics are structured:

- **[verse]**: Sets the scene of dancing under neon skies and feeling like you're in a dream.
- **[chorus]**: A catchy and uplifting refrain about keeping the moment alive and touching the sky with the rhythm.
- **[verse]**: Continues painting the picture of a perfect scene filled with laughter and music.
- **[bridge]**: Introduces the trumpet sound with a mention of a melody that calls out, ringing brightly in a pattern that makes your heart sing. This is where the trumpets would play their riffs—three sets of four repetitions each, with the first two sets being similar and the last one different.
- **[chorus]**: Repeats the uplifting refrain, ensuring it sticks in the listener’s mind.
- **[outro]**: Concludes the song on a note that celebrates the night being young and having time to live within the sweet rhyme.

Now that the tags and lyrics are all set, please press the "generate" button to create this song. Once generated, we can incorporate the trumpet riffs into specific parts of the song as per your request.
