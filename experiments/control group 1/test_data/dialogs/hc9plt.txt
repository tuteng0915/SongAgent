User : 
I want a mellow song with acoustic guitar and English lyrics, something emotional that a Hispanic singer might perform. Can we start with that idea?

I've set up the foundation for your song with a mellow acoustic guitar vibe, emotional English lyrics that could resonate with a Hispanic singer's style. Here are the sections of the lyrics I've come up with:

[verse]
In the quiet of the evening
I strum my guitar and sing
Of the love that once was mine
A melody on the strings

[chorus]
Oh, how I long for your touch
In this sorrowful serenade
My heart beats in rhythm with yours
Though miles may separate our embrace

[verse]
Each note a memory
Of laughter and tears we've shared
The warmth of your hand in mine
A gentle breeze through my hair

[chorus]
Oh, how I long for your touch
In this sorrowful serenade
My heart beats in rhythm with yours
Though miles may separate our embrace

[bridge]
Let the night carry these words
To where you are, across the seas
May they find you and remind you
Of a love carried on the breeze

[chorus]
Oh, how I long for your touch
In this sorrowful serenade
My heart beats in rhythm with yours
Though miles may separate our embrace
