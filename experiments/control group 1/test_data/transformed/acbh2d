Hey there! I’m looking to generate a metal/rock/screamo song that fits the vibe of what I remember. Here’s what I’d like:  

It should be fast-paced, with an intense energy typical of screamo or heavy rock from the 2000s onward. The lyrics need to include "white lie," "white line," or "white noise" repeated twice in succession (like "white lie, white lie"). After that part, there should be another word repeated twice for emphasis, though I don’t have a specific word in mind—feel free to get creative with it!  

Let’s make this track feel raw and emotional, capturing that chaotic yet melodic essence these genres are known for. Can you help me craft something like this?
