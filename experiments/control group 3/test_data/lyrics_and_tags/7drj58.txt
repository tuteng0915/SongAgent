Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the shadows where the echoes start,
A black and white film across my heart.
The static noise of an old TV,
Flickering ghosts of you and me.

[Chorus]
We're living in monochrome dreams tonight,
Caught between the wrong and the right.
Our silhouettes dance in the silver light,
Painting memories in black and white.

[Bridge]
And if we fade to grey,
Will the colors ever stay?
Or will they wash away,
Like ink upon this page?
