Lyrics :
[intro]
Saxophone melody: Slow and smooth first note, followed by 9 quicker notes. Repeats 3 times.

[verse 1]
I see the colors fading out,
Dreams colliding with the night,
We're floating free in this endless sea,
Underneath electric skies.

[chorus]
Take me higher, let's fly tonight,
Through the echoes of our minds,
With every heartbeat, we'll find the light,
In this world that we design.

[verse 2]
Shadows dance upon the walls,
Golden rays break through the haze,
Together we can paint it all,
A canvas born from fleeting days.

[chorus]
Take me higher, let's fly tonight,
Through the echoes of our minds,
With every heartbeat, we'll find the light,
In this world that we design.

[bridge]
Oh oh, we’re infinite tonight,
Lost within a cosmic glow,
Let’s ride these waves till morning comes,
And watch the universe unfold.

[outro chorus]
Take me higher, let's fly tonight,
Through the echoes of our minds,
With every heartbeat, we'll find the light,
In this world that we design.
