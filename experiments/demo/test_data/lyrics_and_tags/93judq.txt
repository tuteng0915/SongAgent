Lyrics :
[verse]
Through the darkest night, I see a light
Guiding me to find my way back home
Every step I take, though wrong turns made
I rise again, with every stone

[chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't back down
With every heartbeat, in this battleground
Phoenix rising from the ashes now
I'll keep on fighting till the clouds part somehow

[verse]
In the silence, hear my voice so loud
Dreams that once were lost now found so proud
The pain was harsh, but it shaped my soul
Now I stand tall, aiming for my goals

[chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't back down
With every heartbeat, in this battleground
Phoenix rising from the ashes now
I'll keep on fighting till the clouds part somehow

[verse]
Battling shadows in a world of gray
Fighting the bottle, day after day
Lost in the haze, but still I strive
Climbing out of the chaos, learning to survive

[bridge]
Let the fire burn within your heart
Fuel the courage, it's a brand new start
Wings of change lift you off the ground
Soaring high where fears no longer confound

[chorus]
I won't give up, no I won't back down
With every heartbeat, in this battleground
Phoenix rising from the ashes now
I'll keep on fighting till the clouds part somehow
