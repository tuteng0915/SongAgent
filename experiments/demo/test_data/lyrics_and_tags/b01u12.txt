Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the neon glow
City lights they come and go
Every heartbeat sets the pace
Underneath the starlit space

[chorus]
Dance among the shadows tall
Electric dreams will never fall
With every step, a rhythm new
This city's pulse, it pulls me through

[verse]
Steel and glass beneath the sky
Reflections dance as moments fly
In the heart of night so bright
We chase the day into the night

[chorus]
Dance among the shadows tall
Electric dreams will never fall
With every step, a rhythm new
This city's pulse, it pulls me through

[bridge]
Oh, the skyline sings tonight
A melody of fading light
Hold on tight, don't let it go
Feel the rush, just let it flow

[chorus]
Dance among the shadows tall
Electric dreams will never fall
With every step, a rhythm new
This city's pulse, it pulls me through
