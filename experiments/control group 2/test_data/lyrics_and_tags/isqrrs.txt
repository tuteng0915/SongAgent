Lyrics :
[verse]
On this crowded bus we ride,
Dreams of us entwined collide.
In the rhythm of the everyday,
I imagine our wedding day.

[chorus]
With every bump and every sway,
We pledge our love in a quiet way.
Passengers as witness to our vow,
This humble bus, somehow sacred now.

[verse]
Your hand in mine, a stolen glance,
Ordinary scenes take on romance.
Seats creak and wheels hum along,
Our secret song, where we belong.

[chorus]
With every bump and every sway,
We pledge our love in a quiet way.
Passengers as witness to our vow,
This humble bus, somehow sacred now.

[bridge]
No frills or fanfare, just us two,
In simplicity, something true.
Among strangers, our hearts confess,
A love unspoken, yet no less.

[chorus]
With every bump and every sway,
We pledge our love in a quiet way.
Passengers as witness to our vow,
This humble bus, somehow sacred now.
