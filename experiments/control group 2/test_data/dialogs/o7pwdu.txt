Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I'm looking to generate a song that captures the essence of a late 90s, radio-friendly, alternative rock track. The song should revolve around the theme of a slacker-type character who sees himself as the hero of his own world. It should have a cheesy, yet catchy vibe that could potentially annoy someone with its repetitive nature. The sound should be typical of 90s alternative music, with a male singer, and feel like it could have been a one-hit wonder played on MTV. Let's create this nostalgic tune!

I've set up the parameters for your late 90s alternative rock track. The tags reflect the era, style, and vibe you're aiming for: a slacker hero with a catchy and repetitive tune that could have been a one-hit wonder on MTV. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
Woke up late again, sun's shining in
Got that same old tune stuck in my brain
I might not change the world, but I'm alright
Living life my way, everything's fine

[chorus]
I'm the king of this place, even if it's just my mind
Everyday's a new adventure, living life unplanned
Yeah I'm a slacker, but I've got style
In my world, I'm number one all the while

... [skipping to the end]

[ending]
So here's to the slackers, the dreamers, the free
To heroes in their own minds, just like you and me
