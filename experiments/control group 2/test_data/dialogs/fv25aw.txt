Hello, Song Agent! I’d like you to *generate* a song based on the following features:

The song should feel like it could have been released around the turn of the decade and could have gained popularity on platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. It should feature a single male artist (or possibly a duo), with an artist name consisting of two words, the first being something like “El” or another similar particle.

The melody should prominently include a steel drum loop, and the beat should draw inspiration from reggae or moombahton. The lyrics can be playful yet rhythmic, capturing the vibe of someone performing live and experimenting with sounds.

For the music video concept, imagine shots of the artist energetically banging his drumsticks on a drum pad to the backbeat, alternating with him fiddling around on a keyboard or sample pad. Intersperse these scenes with visuals of girls taking their shirts off, popping balloons, and maybe even shooting a bow and arrow for some quirky, carefree energy.

Let’s create something that feels nostalgic yet fresh—ready to bring this idea to life?

**Lyrics:**

[verse]
El the beatmaker in his zone
Drumsticks clickin' on the pad alone
Got this steel drum in my loop
Girls poppin' balloons to the groove

[chorus]
It's a YouTube vibe, Vimeo dream
Energetic scenes, popping at the seams
Quirky rhythms, we're shooting bows
Nostalgic feels with a fresh new glow

[verse]
Fiddlin' with keys, making samples sing
Backbeat's so loud, hear the steel drums ring
Arrows flying as we dance all night
Underneath the stars, everything feels right

[bridge]
Steel drums echo, reggae take control
Moombahton beats with a carefree soul
Shirts come off, balloons explode
Live experiments down this road

[chorus]
It's a YouTube vibe, Vimeo dream
Energetic scenes, popping at the seams
Quirky rhythms, we're shooting bows
Nostalgic feels with a fresh new glow
