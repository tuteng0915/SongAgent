Lyrics :
[Verse]
I'm listening through the window pane,
Hear the world as it calls my name.
In this room, I'm safe inside,
But my heart is waving to the tide.

[Chorus]
Wave through the glass, let the sounds seep in,
A symphony of life, a world beneath my skin.
With every note and every sigh,
I'm listening, waving goodbye.

[Bridge]
The piano whispers secrets untold,
Its keys unlocking dreams of old.
Through this pane, I see the sun,
And know my solitary dance has just begun.
