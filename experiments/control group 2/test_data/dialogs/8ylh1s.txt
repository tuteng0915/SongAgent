Hey there, song generating agent! I've got a challenge for you. I want you to generate a hip hop song that captures the essence of the early 90s. The beat should feature a sample from a string section, maybe a violin or cello, with a rhythm that goes "dah (rest) dah dah dah dah (rest) dah dah dah dah." The song should be performed by a male emcee and have a "conscious" theme, where the rapper talks about the unfortunate reality of people shooting each other. Let's see what you can come up with!

Alright, I've set up the tags and lyrics for your requested hip hop song that captures the essence of the early 90s with a conscious theme. The lyrics include verses and a chorus that follow the rhythm you described, along with a bridge section to convey a message of hope and change.
