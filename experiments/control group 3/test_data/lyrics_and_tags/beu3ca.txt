Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night
Stars whisper secrets
Moonlight dances softly
On the edge of my dreams

[chorus]
Floating through the silence
Lost in reverie
Every moment lingers
In this endless sea

[verse]
Echoes of forgotten times
Glowing in the darkness
A journey without end
Where reality blurs

[chorus]
Floating through the silence
Lost in reverie
Every moment lingers
In this endless sea

[bridge]
Time stands still
Breath holds tight
Dreams unfold in silver light

[chorus]
Floating through the silence
Lost in reverie
Every moment lingers
In this endless sea
