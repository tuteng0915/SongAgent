 empty
It seems like the tags are currently empty. Let's proceed with your request for an upbeat, energetic country song in the style of Chris LeDoux, George Strait, or Garth Brooks from the 80s or early 90s. The theme will revolve around rodeos and cowboy life, capturing that classic Western vibe. I'll make sure to include the lyric "Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton" as you requested. Let's generate those tags first so we know what kind of mood and genre we're working with.

Can you specify any particular elements or moods you'd like emphasized in the tags? For example, should it be more "line dance" oriented, or perhaps highlight specific instruments like "guitar" or "fiddle"? Or is there anything else you feel is relevant?
