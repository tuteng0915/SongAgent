Lyrics :
[verse]
In the day we slice and dice, making sandwiches so nice,
At night we trade our aprons for guitars,
[chorus]
We're deli by day, rockstars by night,
Under neon lights, we put on a show,
Dancing through the secret door, where dreams unfold,
Oh, what a tale to tell, when the moon is high,
[verse]
Pickles and jams, we serve with a smile,
But behind closed doors, we let loose in style,
[chorus]
We're deli by day, rockstars by night,
Under neon lights, we put on a show,
Dancing through the secret door, where dreams unfold,
Oh, what a tale to tell, when the moon is high,
[bridge]
The stage is set, the crowd goes wild,
Who knew these hands could play so mild,
From slicing meats to playing beats,
Our double life, a tasty treat,
[chorus]
We're deli by day, rockstars by night,
Under neon lights, we put on a show,
Dancing through the secret door, where dreams unfold,
Oh, what a tale to tell, when the moon is high,
