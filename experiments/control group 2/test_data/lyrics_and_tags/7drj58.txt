Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadowed streets of monochrome
Where silence speaks and colors comb
We walk as shadows in a fading light
Searching for a dream in the dead of night

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call from every door
A symphony of souls who've gone before
And we're dancing to the rhythm of an ancient beat
With our hearts wide open, barefoot on the street

[verse]
Underneath the moon's pale gaze
We find our truth in the maze
Of whispers soft and secrets deep
In this world where ghosts and memories sleep

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call from every door
A symphony of souls who've gone before
And we're dancing to the rhythm of an ancient beat
With our hearts wide open, barefoot on the street

[bridge]
Black and white frames falling down
A silent film with no one around
But we'll color our lives with the love that we make
In this timeless tale, there's no mistake

[chorus]
Oh, the echoes call from every door
A symphony of souls who've gone before
And we're dancing to the rhythm of an ancient beat
With our hearts wide open, barefoot on the street

[outro]
So let's paint the town in shades of grey
Together we'll chase the night away
Hand in hand beneath the starless sky
In this picture perfect moment, we'll never say goodbye
