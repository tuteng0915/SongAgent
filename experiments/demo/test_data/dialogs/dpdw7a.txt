I'd like to create a mellow rock song with an underwater, dreamlike theme. Can you work with that?
Agent : 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by setting some tags that fit your description of a mellow rock song with an underwater, dreamlike theme. I'll also gather more information to better tailor the song to your preferences.

I will now set the initial tags for the song.

Great! The tags have been set to capture the essence of a mellow rock song with an underwater and dreamlike atmosphere.

Next, I'll need to gather more details to create lyrics that align with your vision. Do you have any specific imagery or emotions you'd like the lyrics to evoke? Perhaps there's a certain narrative or elements of the ocean you want to highlight? Let me know so I can proceed with crafting the lyrics.
User : 
The song should feel like a surreal aquatic world within an apartment, with a subtle romantic undertone between two girls. Does that help?
Agent : 
Absolutely, that gives me a clearer picture. A surreal aquatic world within an apartment setting with a romantic undertone between two girls sounds quite poetic and unique.

Let's infuse these elements into the lyrics. I'll craft a few sections that encapsulate the underwater dreaminess and the tender moments shared in this surreal domestic seascape. Let me work on the lyrics now.

The lyrics have been set to reflect the surreal aquatic world within an apartment, capturing the romantic undertone between two girls. Here's a preview of what we've created:

[verse]
In this submerged sanctuary, where silence sings,
Two hearts echo, like gentle flapping wings.
Through windows of seashells, where moonlight bends,
We drift together, our love transcends.

[chorus]
Breathing bubbles, beneath the glass,
An ocean of dreams, in this apartment cast.
With every sway, we softly confess,
A love that's as deep as the blue caress.

[verse]
Neon corals glow in twilight's embrace,
Our fingers entwined, tracing the streams of space.
Whispers of mermaid songs, in currents they flow,
Binding us closer, in this world we know.

[bridge]
Surreal tides turn, in this liquid room,
Where gravity fades, and souls consume.
The surface forgotten, drowned in night,
Together we're lost, in a sea of delight.

[chorus]
Breathing bubbles, beneath the glass,
An ocean of dreams, in this apartment cast.
With every sway, we softly confess,
A love that's as deep as the blue caress.
