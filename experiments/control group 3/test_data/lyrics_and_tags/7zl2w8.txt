Lyrics :
[Intro]
"I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus."
"Could you describe the ruckus?"

[Verse 1]
In the dead of night, shadows come alive,
Whispers through the dark, secrets start to thrive.
The air is thick with tales of old,
Legends never die, they turn to gold.

[Chorus]
Scream it out loud, let the demons hear,
We're the chaos that's closing in, have no fear.
With every beat, we rise above,
This is our time, this is our love.

[Bridge]
Feel the rush, it's electric,
Every moment so cinematic.
Our hearts collide like thunder,
Breaking free from chains that bind us under.

[Chorus]
Scream it out loud, let the demons hear,
We're the chaos that's closing in, have no fear.
With every beat, we rise above,
This is our time, this is our love.

[Outro]
As the echoes fade into the night,
The ruckus turns to silence, but we hold tight.
