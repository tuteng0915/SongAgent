Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet corners of my mind,
Where shadows dance and time stands still,
I find myself amidst the pain,
Of battles fought and dreams that never came.

[chorus]
But there's a light, a flicker in the dark,
A gentle whisper, igniting a spark,
Together we stand, hand in hand,
Outcasts united, breaking through the sand.

[verse]
Through the cracks of broken promises,
We forge our path, a bond unyielding,
Our scars tell stories words can't express,
In this journey of self-discovery and healing.

[verse]
There's a boy who stands with questioning eyes,
Unsure of who he is, what his heart implies,
In a world that asks him to fit in,
He finds solace in love, lets the truth begin.

[bridge]
And though the world may turn its back,
On those who stray from the beaten track,
We'll raise our voices, loud and clear,
For friendship's strength will conquer fear.

[chorus]
There's a light, a beacon in the night,
Guiding us forward, making wrongs right,
Together we rise, with hearts so bold,
Outcasts no more, our story told.
