Lyrics :
[verse]
Standing in a field so wide
Dreams are calling from the sky
Taking a step, leaving it all behind

[chorus]
Floating up where the clouds softly sway
Chasing dreams that never fade away
With every heartbeat, I'm soaring high
Reaching for the endless sky

[verse]
Whispers of hope in the gentle breeze
Promises spoken to the trees
Every moment, a new height I find

[chorus]
Floating up where the clouds softly sway
Chasing dreams that never fade away
With every heartbeat, I'm soaring high
Reaching for the endless sky

[bridge]
In this journey, no chains to bind
Free as the wind, peace of mind
Higher and higher, leaving shadows behind

[chorus]
Floating up where the clouds softly sway
Chasing dreams that never fade away
With every heartbeat, I'm soaring high
Reaching for the endless sky
