Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song based on the following details. The song should be an EDM/pop genre with a female vocalist and have an adventurous, unusual pop vibe. The theme of the lyrics should revolve around a dream state and a difficult relationship. Here are some lines that should be included in the lyrics: «I see how you think I'm crazy, but you're the one that run and hide» and «I want to believe in the lie of the dream». I hope this challenge excites you as much as it does me. Let's create something amazing together!
