Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night
Our hearts beat in syncopation
No words needed between us
Just a glance, a gentle touch

They put me in a box
They tried to put me in a box
But I broke free, found myself
In your arms, where I belong

[chorus]
We speak without a sound
A language born from deep inside
Eyes locked, worlds collide
In this dance, we're intertwined

[verse]
Underneath the starlit sky
Dr. Temperance studies bones
With headphones on, lost in thought
In her world, she's never alone

Every moment spent with you
Feels like time stands still

[chorus]
We speak without a sound
A language born from deep inside
Eyes locked, worlds collide
In this dance, we're intertwined

[bridge]
Together we explore
The depths of our souls
Each step, a new discovery
In this journey, we are whole

[chorus]
We speak without a sound
A language born from deep inside
Eyes locked, worlds collide
In this dance, we're intertwined
