Lyrics :
[verse]
In the night, she's my guiding star,
With her by my side, I've come so far.
Every heartbeat echoes her name,
My girlfriend, my love, forever the same.

[chorus]
Oh, my girlfriend, you light up my world,
With every kiss, with every swirl.
My girlfriend, my heart's in your hand,
Together we'll conquer, together we stand.

[verse]
Her laughter's a melody that never fades,
In this crazy life, she's my serenade.
Through the highs and lows, she's always there,
My girlfriend, my muse, beyond compare.

[chorus]
Oh, my girlfriend, you light up my world,
With every kiss, with every swirl.
My girlfriend, my heart's in your hand,
Together we'll conquer, together we stand.

[bridge]
When the world gets too heavy, she lifts me high,
In her embrace, I'm ready to fly.
No storm can break us, we're built to last,
With my girlfriend, the future's the past.

[chorus]
Oh, my girlfriend, you light up my world,
With every kiss, with every swirl.
My girlfriend, my heart's in your hand,
Together we'll conquer, together we stand.
