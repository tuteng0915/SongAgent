Hello, Song Agent! I’d like to request a song that captures a specific vibe and structure. Here’s what I’m looking for:

The track should open with dialogue quotes from a film scene. Specifically:  
- First quote: *"I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus."*  
- Second quote: *"Could you describe the ruckus?"*  

Immediately following the dialogue, the music should kick in hard with loud, energetic guitars—think raw, powerful rock instrumentation. If possible, include intense screaming vocals to amplify the chaotic and explosive mood.

Can you generate lyrics and tags for this concept? Let’s call it an aggressive rock anthem with cinematic flair!  

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
