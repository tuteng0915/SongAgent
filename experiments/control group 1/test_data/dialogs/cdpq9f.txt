[Verse]
In the quiet of the night,
Your voice is my guiding light,
Every word, every sigh,
Fills my world with why.

[Chorus]
Love like a gentle breeze,
Carries us through the trees,
Hand in hand, we'll never part,
You hold the key to my heart.

[Bridge]
Through every storm, through every fight,
With you, everything feels right,
Our journey's just begun,
Together, we are one.
