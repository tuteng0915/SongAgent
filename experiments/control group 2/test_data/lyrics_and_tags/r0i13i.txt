Lyrics :
[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the rhythm, feel it too
Dancing under starry skies
Let the music take you high

[verse]
Step by step, we move along
In this journey of song and fun
Every beat, every single sound
Brings us closer, love unbound

[bridge]
Turn it up, let's celebrate
Life's a dance floor, don't be late
Feel the pulse, hear the groove
Together we'll make our hearts improve

[chorus]
You've got to break (pause) through
Feel the rhythm, feel it too
Dancing under starry skies
Let the music take you high
