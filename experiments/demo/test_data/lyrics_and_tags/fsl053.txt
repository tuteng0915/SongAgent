Lyrics :
[verse]
Shackles and chains, they bind my soul
In endless silence, where shadows console

[chorus]
I'm reaching for a lifeline slipping fast
A fleeting moment that won't forever last

[verse]
Echoes of memories, haunt like a ghost
Yearning for a spark, to light what I lost

[bridge]
And every heartbeat pounds like thunder
Breaking through the dark, I stumble under
The weight of all these dreams untold
Searching for a way to break the mold

[chorus]
I'm reaching for a lifeline slipping fast
A fleeting moment that won't forever last
