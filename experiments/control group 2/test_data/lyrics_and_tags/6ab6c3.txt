Lyrics :
[verse]
In a world so strange, like an old cartoon
Where shadows dance under the moon
I hear your call, it’s haunting me
Like echoes from another galaxy

[chorus]
You’re controlling me, like a puppet on a string
In this cosmic dance, to which I can't cling
Alien eyes, watching from above
Controlling me, with an extraterrestrial love

[verse]
Neon lights flash, in this eerie night
A phantom force takes my hand tight
Together we drift through space and time
Bound by secrets that none can find

[chorus]
You’re controlling me, like a puppet on a string
In this cosmic dance, to which I can't cling
Alien eyes, watching from above
Controlling me, with an extraterrestrial love

[bridge]
The stars align, as you whisper low
A language unknown, yet I seem to know
This foreign touch, cold but divine
A mystery that's yours and mine

[chorus]
You’re controlling me, like a puppet on a string
In this cosmic dance, to which I can't cling
Alien eyes, watching from above
Controlling me, with an extraterrestrial love

[outro]
Fade away, into the endless sky
Our story written in the stars' reply
Forever bound, by forces unseen
Controlling me, in this dream within a dream
