I'd love to create a song that captures the mid-2000s emo/post-hardcore vibe you're looking for. To start, could you give me a general idea of what you'd like the lyrics in the first half to focus on? Maybe some emotions or themes you want to explore?
Agent : 
Sure, let's aim for themes of longing and introspection in the first half. We'll focus on emotions like nostalgia, heartache, and the struggle to find one's place. Let's set these thematic elements with some tags and draft the initial lyrics.

I will now set the tags and lyrics for the song.

The tags and initial lyrics have been set to capture that mid-2000s emo/post-hardcore vibe with themes of nostalgia and heartache. 

Remember, you need to press the "generate" button to create the song with these settings. Once we have the first part of the song generated, we can proceed with the second half. How does that sound?
