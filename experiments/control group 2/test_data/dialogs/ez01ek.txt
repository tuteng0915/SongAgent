Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song based on some features I remember from a song I once heard. The song should have female vocals and be in the pop-rock genre, ideally released in the 2000s. The theme of the song revolves around outcasts and troubled, mostly young, people.

Each verse should tell the story of a different person. One particular verse should focus on a boy who is unsure if he is a boy or a girl, and this uncertainty should be reflected in the lyrics without being a direct quote. 

Could you generate such a song for me?

I have generated a song that fits the description you provided. It includes female vocals in a pop-rock genre, reminiscent of songs from the 2000s. The theme focuses on outcasts and troubled youth, with each verse telling the story of a different person. One verse specifically explores the uncertainty of a boy questioning his gender identity.

Here's a snippet of the lyrics:

```
[verse]
In a small town where whispers run deep
Lives a soul with a secret to keep
Lost between worlds, not here nor there
A boy or a girl, they're never quite sure

[chorus]
We rise above the ashes of our past
Misfits and dreamers, we're breaking free at last
Together we stand, in this world so vast
Outcasts united, finding home at last
```
