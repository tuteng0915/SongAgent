Lyrics :
[verse]
Waking up to the sunrise glow
Feel the world calling out to go
Step by step, we're breaking free
Chasing dreams beneath the endless sky

[chorus]
Live it up, let the music play
Dancing through the night and into day
We'll take the world in our hands
Feel alive, this is our time to shine

[verse]
Every moment's a chance to grow
With the sun on our face, we'll never slow
Together we'll ride the waves of gold
Living every story that's yet untold

[chorus]
Live it up, let the music play
Dancing through the night and into day
We'll take the world in our hands
Feel alive, this is our time to shine

[bridge]
As the stars align in the midnight blue
Our journey's just begun, me and you
In this summer haze, we'll find our way
To the rhythm of the night and day

[jazz section]
Oh, when the lights go down
And the music takes control
We'll be lost in the sound
Where the wild winds blow

[chorus]
Live it up, let the music play
Dancing through the night and into day
We'll take the world in our hands
Feel alive, this is our time to shine
