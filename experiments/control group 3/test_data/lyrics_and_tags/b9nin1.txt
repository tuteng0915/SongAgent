Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of your name
I find the shadows of our flame

[chorus]
Lost in the whispers of yesterday
Nostalgia pulls me back to stay
In this bittersweet symphony of longing
Our love, a tale forever haunting

[verse]
Walking through memories paved with gold
Each step a story, each breath so cold

[bridge]
But even as time twists and turns
The heart remembers what it yearns
A touch, a smile, in silence speaks
Of all that was, and all it seeks

[chorus]
Lost in the whispers of yesterday
Nostalgia pulls me back to stay
In this bittersweet symphony of longing
Our love, a tale forever haunting
