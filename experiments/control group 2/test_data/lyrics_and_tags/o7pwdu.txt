Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up late again, sun's shining in
Got that same old tune stuck in my brain
I might not change the world, but I'm alright
Living life my way, everything's fine

[chorus]
I'm the king of this place, even if it's just my mind
Everyday's a new adventure, living life unplanned
Yeah I'm a slacker, but I've got style
In my world, I'm number one all the while

[verse]
Walking down the street with no care in sight
People say I'm lazy, but I know what's right
Got my own pace, got my own dreams
Even if they're made of corduroy and jeans

[chorus]
I'm the star of this show, even if it's just TV
Every moment's worth capturing, can't you see?
Yeah I'm a dreamer, with a capital D
In my story, I'm the legend of the free

[bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, living life like a song
Oh, oh, oh, nothing really goes wrong
Just cruising along, on my own little ride
With my guitar solo, and my foolish pride

[chorus]
I may not be your idol, but I'm cool for today
Strumming chords through the haze, chasing night into day
Yeah I'm a slacker, with a heart full of dreams
In my universe, I'm as big as it seems

[ending]
So here's to the slackers, the dreamers, the free
To heroes in their own minds, just like you and me
