Great! Now, let's draft some lyrics that match the inspirational tone and style you're looking for.

Here are the initial lyrics:

[Verse]
In the morning light I see a new day
With every step, there's a price to pay
But I won't back down, I'll take the stand
With every heartbeat, I feel the demand

[Chorus]
Rise up, it’s time to shine
Feel the power, you’re divine
In this world, we’ll make our way
Together strong, come what may

[Bridge]
Every challenge, every fight
Makes us stronger in the night
Dreams will guide us through the haze
In this journey, we blaze

[Chorus]
Rise up, it’s time to shine
Feel the power, you’re divine
In this world, we’ll make our way
Together strong, come what may
