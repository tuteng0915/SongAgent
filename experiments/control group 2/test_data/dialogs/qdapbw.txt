Hello, song generating agent! I have a fun challenge for you. I'd like you to generate a song that fits the following description:

The song should be in the style of classic pop from the 60s to the 80s, featuring a female vocalist with a light, catchy pop sound. The only lyrics I can recall are "Down, down," so could you incorporate those words into the song? 

Let's create something that captures the essence of that era while being a fresh, new tune.

Can you do that for me?

I've tailored a song that embodies the classic pop sound from the 60s to the 80s, complete with a female vocalist's light and catchy touch. Here are the lyrics I've come up with:

```
[verse]
Down, down, like a leaf falling to the ground
Wandering freely without a sound

[chorus]
Down, down, where the dreams are never found
In this crazy world, we keep spinning round

[bridge]
Shadows dance as daylight fades away
But there's a spark that will always stay

[chorus]
Down, down, where the dreams are never found
In this crazy world, we keep spinning round
```

Now that we have our tags and lyrics ready, please press the "generate" button to create the song.
