Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I would like you to generate a song that blends R&B, pop, and psychedelic soul, capturing the essence of the late 1960s to early 1970s. The song should be upbeat and catchy, reminiscent of "September" by Earth, Wind & Fire. It should feature a deep male voice singing the lyrics "can you dig it baby," supported by female backup vocalists. The overall feel of the song should be beautiful and vibrant, with a touch of Marvin Sease's style in the male vocals. Let's create something that could have been played at a lively dance party from that era. Please include suitable tags for the song as well.
