Lyrics :
[verse]
Through desert sands and canyon wide,
A lone soul rides with nothing but pride.
The sun beats down, his shadow fades,
But he don't stop, no debts left unpaid.

[chorus]
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,
In this wild world, you're never alone.
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.

[verse]
He lost it all, love turned to dust,
Dreams fell apart, yeah, life ain't just.
Yet every scar tells what he's worth,
A fighter's heart beneath the hurt.

[chorus]
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,
In this wild world, you're never alone.
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.

[bridge]
Mountains crumble, rivers dry,
But a man's resolve will never die.
With each new dawn, there comes a fight,
And hope burns bright even through the night.

[chorus]
Oh, hold your ground, you're made of stone,
In this wild world, you're never alone.
Though the winds howl loud and skies turn gray,
Rise again tomorrow, find your way.
