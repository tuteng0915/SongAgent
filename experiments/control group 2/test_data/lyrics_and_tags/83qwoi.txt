Lyrics :
[verse]
I remember when the world stood still,
When your voice would echo through the hills.
We were young and reckless, chasing dreams,
But love was all we needed in between.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.

[verse]
The nights were cold, but we burned so bright,
Our shadows dancing under moonlight.
Every heartbeat pulling us along,
But nothing felt as right as this love song.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.

[bridge]
Time moves on, but memories remain,
In every whisper of the falling rain.
If I could turn back time, Iâ€™d find
The place where we left our hearts behind.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.
