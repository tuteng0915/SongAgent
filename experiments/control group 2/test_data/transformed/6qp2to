Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song that captures the essence of a story I have in mind. The song should have an extremely catchy beat, but with a softer, emotive voice for the chorus. The theme revolves around a woman who relentlessly pursues a man, faces betrayal, and eventually discovers her own path to independence. The lyrics should reflect her emotional journey—her determination, heartbreak, and ultimate empowerment. To match the mood, the song could be imagined as being set against a black-and-white visual backdrop. 

Can you create something that embodies all of this?
