Lyrics :
[verse]
A is for Alice who fell down the stairs,
B is for Bob who was scared by the bears,
C is for Carol consumed by the night,
D is for Dan who was taken by fright.

[chorus]
In the shadows they dance, under moon's ghastly glow,
Each tale a macabre twist, as the alphabet winds low.
From A to Z, their fates unfold,
In this Halloween story, bizarre and bold.

[verse]
E is for Eve caught in cobwebs thick,
F is for Frank bitten quick by a tick,
G is for Grace lost within a ghostly game,
H is for Harry haunted by his name.

[chorus]
In the shadows they dance, under moon's ghastly glow,
Each tale a macabre twist, as the alphabet winds low.
From A to Z, their fates unfold,
In this Halloween story, bizarre and bold.

[bridge]
Illuminated by the jack-o'-lantern's light,
Every letter a new terror, every sound a fright.
Through the darkened halls where whispers multiply,
Our ghastly alphabet ends with a final goodbye.
