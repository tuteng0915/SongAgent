Lyrics :
[verse]
Driving down that open road
Got my freedom, got my load
Sun is shining on my face
I'm in love with this wild race

[chorus]
Living life like a country song
With a beat that makes the party strong
Rolling by with some rock and roll
And a touch of pop in my soul

[verse]
Radio's playing loud and clear
Every note takes me right here
Where the skies are big and blue
And the nights are made for you

[chorus]
Living life like a country song
With a beat that makes the party strong
Rolling by with some rock and roll
And a touch of pop in my soul

[bridge]
Oh, we're dancing under neon lights
Feeling alive, feeling alright
In this moment, nothing else matters
Just hold on tight, let the music shatter

[chorus]
Living life like a country song
With a beat that makes the party strong
Rolling by with some rock and roll
And a touch of pop in my soul
