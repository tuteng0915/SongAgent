Lyrics :
[verse]
On the rooftop edge tonight
She teeters close, her soul in flight
Her shoe slips off and falls like fate
I race to save her; it's not too late

[chorus]
In your eyes I saw the start
Of a journey, hand to heart
But now those stars have turned to scars
A love torn by cruel wars

[verse]
Together we laughed, we danced, we burned
But the fire that warmed us soon concerned
Your touch, once tender, grew tight with pain
Possessive whispers like pouring rain

[bridge]
You held my world but wouldn't let go
Strings of your making pulled me low
The fights, the tears, the endless nights
Our love dissolved into dark spite

[chorus]
In your eyes I saw the start
Of a journey, hand to heart
But now those stars have turned to scars
A love torn by cruel wars

[verse]
Back on the rooftop, the air so cold
Another shoe drops, the story retold
Below, someone looks up in despair
And reaches out for the help you won't spare

[outro]
Oh, the cycle spins, it never ends
A tragic loop that love pretends
To heal, to mendâ€”but brings us down
Forever lost as fates revolve around
