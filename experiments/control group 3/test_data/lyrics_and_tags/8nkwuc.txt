Lyrics :
[verse]
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Feelin' good, feeling great, ain't life a beaut'
Got the funk in my trunk, got my homies on the floor
Life's a beach and we're just living our dream

[chorus]
It's the G-funk era, baby, don't you see
Smooth as silk, like a melody
We ride low, with our hats to the back
Living this life, no need to look back

[bridge]
Synthesizers humming, bassline so thick
In this world of music, we're pickin' up tricks
From LA to The Bay, we keep it real tight
G-funk forever, into the night

[chorus]
It's the G-funk era, baby, don't you see
Smooth as silk, like a melody
We ride low, with our hats to the back
Living this life, no need to look back
