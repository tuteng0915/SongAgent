Lyrics :
[verse]
In the silence of the night
I feel the chains fall away
Every heartbeat is a drumbeat
Calling out to break away

[chorus]
All my life I've waited for this moment
To dance under the starlit sky
Feel the rhythm take us high
Breaking free like birds in flight
Empowered by the moonlit night

[verse]
Shadows fade as we rise up
Dancing through the midnight air
With every step, we claim our power
In this moment, we're aware

[chorus]
All my life I've waited for this moment
To dance under the starlit sky
Feel the rhythm take us high
Breaking free like birds in flight
Empowered by the moonlit night

[bridge]
No more holding back, no more fear
The world is ours, the time is near
Together we can do anything
Our spirits soar on silver wings

[chorus]
All my life I've waited for this moment
To dance under the starlit sky
Feel the rhythm take us high
Breaking free like birds in flight
Empowered by the moonlit night
