Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by specifying the genre of the song. You mentioned punk/rock or alternative. Which one would you prefer for this song?
Agent : 
To better assist you, could you please specify which genre you prefer for this song: punk/rock or alternative? This will help me tailor the song to your taste. If you're open to suggestions, I can also provide a mix of both styles. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. 

In the meantime, I'll go ahead and fetch your preferences to ensure the song aligns with your past requests.


the user has not given their preferences yet.
Since I don't have your specific preferences on file yet, feel free to specify whether you'd prefer the song to be more punk/rock or alternative. Or, if you'd like, I can create a blend of both genres for a unique sound. Once you decide, we can move forward with generating the lyrics and setting the appropriate tags.

Please let me know your choice so we can continue crafting your song. If you need inspiration, I could also suggest some themes or topics for the song. What do you think?
