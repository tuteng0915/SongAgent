Lyrics :
[verse]
I see the lights, they're calling me
In the night, where I long to be
Got my feet up on the stereo
Feeling like I'm ready to go

[chorus]
Lasers in the sky, shooting through the night
We'll dance until we touch the light
With every beat, feel the energy ignite
Lasers in our hearts, we're taking flight

[verse]
Every move is like a melody
Each step a note in symphony
Together we create a dream
A world of colors, more than it seems

[chorus]
Lasers in the sky, shooting through the night
We'll dance until we touch the light
With every beat, feel the energy ignite
Lasers in our hearts, we're taking flight

[bridge]
Feel the bassline moving through your soul
Electric waves that make us whole
Hands up high, let the rhythm take control
In this moment, we are infinite

[chorus]
Lasers in the sky, shooting through the night
We'll dance until we touch the light
With every beat, feel the energy ignite
Lasers in our hearts, we're taking flight
