Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shade of a worn-out hat
Dreaming 'bout the roads we've sat
Che's shadow on the wall
In Havana's echoing hall

[chorus]
Oh the stories in the air
Of revolution everywhere
With a spirit that won't fade
In the dance of every serenade

[bridge]
From the hills to old cuba's shore
Memories forever soar
Carried on a gentle breeze
Whispered in the mango trees
