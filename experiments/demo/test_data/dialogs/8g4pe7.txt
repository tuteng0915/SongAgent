I'd like a song that starts with vocals only or maybe just a soft accompaniment, something mellow and repetitive like "Naa nananana..." or "La's." It should be in the style of soft or classic rock. Can you work with that?

Sure, I can work with that. To make sure I get it right, could you specify any particular themes or emotions you want the song to convey? For example, is this a song about love, longing, happiness, or something else? Also, do you have a preference for the length of the song or any specific instruments you'd like to feature?
User : 
It should convey a sense of nostalgia, like looking back at good times. No specific length, but maybe include some guitar solos since it's rock.

I've crafted a song based on your preferences. It begins softly with simple vocal harmonies, setting a nostalgic tone that carries through verses filled with memories and friendship. The song features guitar solos as requested, adding to the classic rock feel. Hereâ€™s a preview of the lyrics:

```
[Intro]
Naa nananana... 
La la la...

[Verse 1]
Walking down these streets I've known,
Memories like whispers in the stone.
Every corner holds a song,
Of the good old days that didn't last long.

[Chorus]
Oh, those golden days,
With the sun on our face,
We danced under starlit skies,
In the warmth of each other's eyes.
...
```

Guitar strings hum with tales untold,
Of friendships strong and dreams so bold.
Each note a memory we hold dear,
Echoing through time, always near.

[Chorus]
Oh, those golden days,
With the sun on our face,
We danced under starlit skies,
In the warmth of each other's eyes.

[Bridge]
And though the road may wind and wander,
The soul of rock will guide us yonder.
Through every high and every low,
The music plays where'er we go.

[Outro]
Naa nananana... 
La la la...
