Hello, song generating agent! I have a fun challenge for you. I'd like you to generate a comedy acapella-style song about a person whose laptop fails to work. As the song unfolds, it should humorously detail the increasingly crazy obstacles this person must endure in their quest to either fix the laptop or get revenge for it not working. At some point, the lyrics should include a reference to Bill Gates. The chorus of the song should feature these lyrics: "The system has gone down. Down-oooooh, down-oooooh, the system has gone down." 

Can you create such a song for me?
