Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I call your name
Running through shadows, consumed by the pain

[chorus]
We rise, we fall together
In this moment, there's no fear
Our laughter fills the silence
And chases all the ghosts so clear

[verse]
But now the sky is dark and heavy with rain
Promises broken like fragile glass panes

[chorus]
Tension grows, hearts collide in vain
The echoes of love lost, they chain

[bridge]
Shattered dreams under moonlit skies
Heartbreak paints a tearful goodbye

[chorus]
In the haunting whispers of the breeze
I hear your voice, memories freeze

[outro]
A lingering specter of what we had
Haunting steps on a desolate path
