Hello, song generating agent! I am looking to create a victorious-sounding rock/pop song that captures the energy and emotion of a sports victory scene in a movie. The song should feel modern, as if it could have been released by a band within the last 10 years.

Here are some specific features I'd like to include:
- The chorus should start with the singer belting out an energetic "OH" on the notes "G," "Ab," and "Eb."
- These "OH" vocals should be repeated several times throughout the chorus, harmonizing with powerful guitar riffs.
- The overall tone should be uplifting, triumphant, and motivationalâ€”perfect for celebrating a hard-fought victory.

Could you generate such a song for me? Please provide the lyrics and any relevant tags that fit this description. Thank you!

[verse]
We fought the fight, we stood our ground
Through every challenge, we never backed down
With every heartbeat, we pushed ahead
Our spirits unbroken, no fear of what's ahead

[chorus]
OH OH OH (G) OH OH OH (Ab) OH OH OH (Eb)
Victory is ours, shining like the sun
Feel the rush, the battle's won
Together we rise, together we run
OH OH OH (G) OH OH OH (Ab) OH OH OH (Eb)

[verse]
Against all odds, we took the stand
Hand in hand, we made our last stand
In the arena, where legends are born
Our hearts on fire, as the final horn

Lift your hands to the sky
Feel the moment, it's time to fly
In this triumph, we find our way
Together we'll seize the day

Victory is ours, shining like the sun
Feel the rush, the battle's won
Together we rise, together we run
