Lyrics :
[Verse]
Climbing high where eagles dare,
Breathless peaks, I claim my lair.
Battles fought, in silence won,
Crowned by fate, the chosen one.

[Chorus]
King of the hill, against the sky,
Where dreams ascend and legends lie.
Unyielding strength, our war cry loud,
Ruling shadows, proud and unbowed.

[Bridge]
Through valleys deep and mountains steep,
A throne of trials, a vow to keep.
Alone I stand, yet never weak,
For every scar shapes what I seek.
