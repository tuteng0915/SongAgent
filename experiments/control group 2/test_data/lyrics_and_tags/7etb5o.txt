Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadow of the mudslide
Watching eyes from satellites collide
Lost souls in digital dreams
Searching for a sign unseen

[chorus]
Clay hands reaching for the sky
Satellite visions where we all die
Through the static and the sorrow
We watch him fade, no tomorrow

[bridge]
Transmission lost in endless flight
A silent witness to the night
Frequencies echo through the haze
Signals fade in cosmic rays

[chorus]
Clay hands reaching for the sky
Satellite visions where we all die
Through the static and the sorrow
We watch him fade, no tomorrow
