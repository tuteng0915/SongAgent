Hello, song generating agent! I have a task for you. Instead of finding an existing song, could you generate a new song that matches the following description?

I'm looking for a catchy tune with dance/disco beats and strings throughout the song, reminiscent of "Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve but less sophisticated. The vocalist should be female, with a light and soft voice similar to Dido or Sheryl Crow. The chorus should include some "yeah yeah" parts. The overall vibe should be nostalgic, like a blast from the past, specifically from the early or mid-2000s.

Could you create such a song for me?

Lyrics:

[verse]
Woke up from a dream
Where the music was streaming
In my mind, in my soul
I'm losing control

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us

[verse]
Every step that we take
Feels like time is shaking
In our world, in our hearts
We'll never fall apart

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us

[bridge]
It's been a long time coming
But I feel it in my bones
The rhythm is calling
And I can't resist it no more

[chorus]
Yeah yeah, let's go back to the past
Yeah yeah, when love was everlasting
Yeah yeah, we danced under the stars
Yeah yeah, like nothing could break us
