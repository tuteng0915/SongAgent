User : 
Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song based on some details I have in mind. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should feel like a 90’s pop ballad, sung by a female artist, and could fit as part of a movie soundtrack. The chorus needs to be catchy with an "ohhhhhhhh"/"oh-ohhhhhh" kind of vibe, followed by three short lines that are almost identical except for the last one, which ends slightly higher in pitch. It would also be great if it had that nostalgic, timeless quality that makes it memorable.  

Can you help me create something like this?

[verse]
I remember when the world stood still,
When your voice would echo through the hills.
We were young and reckless, chasing dreams,
But love was all we needed in between.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.

[verse]
The nights were cold, but we burned so bright,
Our shadows dancing under moonlight.
Every heartbeat pulling us along,
But nothing felt as right as this love song.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.

[bridge]
Time moves on, but memories remain,
In every whisper of the falling rain.
If I could turn back time, I’d find
The place where we left our hearts behind.

[chorus]
Ohhhhhhhh, oh-ohhhhhh
Take me back to where it all began,
Take me back to the moment you held my hand,
Take me back, take me higher than before.
