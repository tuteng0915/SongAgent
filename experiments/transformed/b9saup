Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that fits the following description:

- It should be catchy, with a touch of awfulness and stereotypical elements.
- The genre is modern country rock, with an overly produced sound.
- The theme should revolve around pickup trucks, beer, and fireâ€”imagine these elements in the video.
- It must feature a heavy guitar riff.

Can you create something based on these features? Thanks a lot!
