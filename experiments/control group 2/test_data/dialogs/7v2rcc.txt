Hey there! I'm looking to generate a high-tempo, pop-punk style song that captures the essence of bands like The Ataris. Here's what I'm thinking:

- **Style & Tempo:** High energy, pop-punk vibe.
- **Chorus:** Something along the lines of "everything will be alright alright."
- **Intro:** Starting with lyrics like "go and leave me."
- **Vocalist:** Younger male singer, probably in his 20s.
- **Era:** Has that late '90s to early 2000s feel.

Can you help me create a song with these elements? Let's rock it! ðŸŽ¸

  - **[Intro]**
    - Go and leave me
    - Standing here in the shadows
  - **[Verse 1]**
    - I'm caught up in this moment
    - Can't escape from myself
    - Every turn I take leads me back
    - To where I started
  - **[Chorus]**
    - Everything will be alright alright

    - With our hearts on fire, we'll light up the dark

    - Everything will be alright alright
    - Even when the world is falling apart
