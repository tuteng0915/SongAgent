Hello, Song Agent! I would like you to generate a song that serves as an interlude for an album. The song should be primarily piano-based and feature a dialogue between a man and a woman. In the dialogue, the man says, "Meaning in life is just something you cultivate." The woman responds, "Like roses?" and the man replies, "Exactly like roses. Until it's not." Please create this song for me.
