### Lyrics:
```
[Verse]
Waking up to a brand new day
Paths untrodden, skies so gray
Hear the whispers in the breeze
Calling out from distant seas

[Chorus]
We're explorers in an endless quest
For treasures hidden in the west
With every step, we find our way
In this journey, come what may

[Bridge]
Through valleys deep and mountains high
Beneath the vast unending sky
Each moment holds a mystery
A world unknown, waiting for me

[Chorus]
We're explorers in an endless quest
For treasures hidden in the west
With every step, we find our way
In this journey, come what may

[Outro]
And when the night falls, stars will guide
Our hearts that beat with dreams inside
Forever searching, forever free
Bound by wonder, you and me
```

Let me set these lyrics.
