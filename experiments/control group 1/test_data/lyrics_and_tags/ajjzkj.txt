Lyrics :
[verse]
Move your feet to the funky beat
Feel the rhythm, can't be beat
Dance floor's calling, come on complete
Let the music take your seat

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, it's time to dance
Shake it off, give it a chance
Everybody get in the groove
Let's make this party a blast to prove

[verse]
Electric vibes, they light us up
Hands in the air, we can't stop
Spin around, let the bass drop
In this moment, we're non-stop

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, it's time to dance
Shake it off, give it a chance
Everybody get in the groove
Let's make this party a blast to prove

[bridge]
The night is young, so much fun
Underneath the strobe lights, we become
One with the music, lose control
Together we'll rock this golden soul
