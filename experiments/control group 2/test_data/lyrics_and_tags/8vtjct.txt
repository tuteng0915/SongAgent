Lyrics :
[verse]
In the silence of the morning light,
I find my peace, everything feels right.
Whispers of hope in the gentle breeze,
Carry my soul to a place of ease.

[chorus]
Oh, the sweet sound of silence,
Where our dreams begin to unfold.
With every breath, with every sigh,
In this quiet space, we find our gold.

[bridge]
Together we rise, voices blend,
In harmony, our souls transcend.
A gospel choir, soft and true,
Guided by the light, we pass through.
