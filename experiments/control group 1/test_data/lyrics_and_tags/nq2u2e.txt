Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows of the night
We dance like flames under neon lights

[chorus]
Love is a game, it's a dangerous ride
But with you, I'll take my chances tonight
Electric hearts, they collide
In this moment, we're electrified

[verse]
Every touch, every kiss
Sets the world on fire, it's bliss

[chorus]
Love is a game, it's a dangerous ride
But with you, I'll take my chances tonight
Electric hearts, they collide
In this moment, we're electrified

[bridge]
Feel the rush, it's a high
Dancing on the edge, no alibi

[chorus]
Love is a game, it's a dangerous ride
But with you, I'll take my chances tonight
Electric hearts, they collide
In this moment, we're electrified
