Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking into the neon glow,
of a bar I used to know,
A place where stories intertwine,
And every night feels so divine.

[pre-chorus]
I see her silhouette in the dim light,
Her eyes are like stars in the night,
We share a smile, a moment in time,
In this bar, everything feels fine.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong,
With a dirty old martini all night long,
It's the drink of love and dreams,
In this retro scene, it gleams.

[verse]
Underneath the disco ball we dance,
Lost in the rhythm, caught in a trance,
The night is young, our hearts alight,
With every sip, everything's alright.

[bridge]
As the night fades to a gentle close,
We find ourselves nobody knows,
But with a martini in hand, we're free,
In this 80s reverie.

[chorus]
You can never go wrong,
With a dirty old martini all night long,
It's the drink of love and dreams,
In this retro scene, it gleams.
