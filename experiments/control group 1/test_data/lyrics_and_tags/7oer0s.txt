Lyrics :
[verse]
We've fought our way through the storm
Every challenge we've transformed
Into fuel for the fire inside

[chorus]
Victory is ours tonight
We'll raise our banners high and bright
Feel the power in our veins
Nothing ever will be the same

[verse]
With every step, we break the chain
Shatter doubts like brittle glass panes
Our hearts are beating loud and clear

[chorus]
Victory is ours tonight
We'll raise our banners high and bright
Feel the power in our veins
Nothing ever will be the same

[bridge]
Through sweat and tears, we've come so far
Eyes on the prize, we've raised the bar
This is our moment to shine

[chorus]
Victory is ours tonight
We'll raise our banners high and bright
Feel the power in our veins
Nothing ever will be the same

[outro]
Raise your hands to the sky
Feel the thrill as we touch the stars high
Let the echoes of triumph ring
In this night of victory, we sing
