Lyrics :
[verse]
Lost in the echoes of my mind
I find no solace, no peace to find

[chorus]
Pills on the table, silent screams
The world keeps turning, or so it seems

[verse]
In this darkness, I'm losing track
Of who I am and what I lack

[bridge]
C-B-A, counting down
Each letter a memory, a lost crown

[chorus]
Pills on the table, silent cries
The world moves on as hope goodbye
