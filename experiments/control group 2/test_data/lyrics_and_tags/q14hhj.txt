Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night I hear,
a whisper in the wind so clear.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[verse]
Beneath the silver moon's soft glow,
I search for pieces of us to show.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[bridge]
Every strum on my guitar sings,
of moments we lived, of everything.

[chorus]
Your voice is a melody locked in time,
haunting these echoes, lost yet mine.

[final]
And as the silence wraps around,
I finally remember the sound you used to call me.
