Lyrics :
[verse]
Woke up to the same old sky
Another day goes flashing by
I'm trapped inside this endless loop
My dreams are lost, there's no way out

[chorus]
Stuck in this rut, I'm losing my mind
Every day's the same, I'm running out of time
I need to break free, spread my wings and fly
But I can't escape this life that I despise

[verse]
The clock keeps ticking, never slows down
Each moment drags, like chains around
I try to find some solace here
But peace eludes me, year after year

[chorus]
Stuck in this rut, I'm losing my mind
Every day's the same, I'm running out of time
I need to break free, spread my wings and fly
But I can't escape this life that I despise

[bridge]
Is there a way to change my fate?
Or am I doomed to meet the same slate?
I long for something more than this
A chance to live, to truly exist

[chorus]
Stuck in this rut, I'm losing my mind
Every day's the same, I'm running out of time
I need to break free, spread my wings and fly
But I can't escape this life that I despise
