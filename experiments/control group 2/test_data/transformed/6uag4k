Request to the Song Generating Agent:  
I need you to generate a song that matches these features: it should feel driven and rhythmic, with an almost industrial or mechanical sound—like a clinking chain in a steady beat: BOOM, CLINK, BOOM, CLINK. Over this relentless rhythm, there needs to be a female vocalist singing somberly about themes of loss and longing. The tone should evoke emotion, as if it could belong in a powerful movie trailer scene. Let’s create something that captures this mood and energy.
