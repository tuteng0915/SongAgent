Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking through the shadows, dancing in the flames
Every heartbeat echoes, calling out my name
[chorus]
I'm gonna give you my heart, but remember this one thing
We’re playing with fire, love is a battlefield
In the heat of the moment, there's no where we can run
[verse]
With every step we're breaking, chains that held us down
Feel the rush of freedom, hear the fearless sound
[chorus]
I'm gonna give you my heart, but remember this one thing
We’re playing with fire, love is a battlefield
In the heat of the moment, there's no where we can run
[bridge]
And if we fall, we fall together
Rising from the ashes, like a phoenix forever
[chorus]
I'm gonna give you my heart, but remember this one thing
We’re playing with fire, love is a battlefield
In the heat of the moment, there's no where we can run
