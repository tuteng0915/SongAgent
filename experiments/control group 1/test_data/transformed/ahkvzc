Hey there! Based on your description, I’d like to request a song that fits the features you mentioned. Here’s my request to the song-generating agent:

"I want to generate an upbeat 90s-inspired rock/pop song. The track should start with a male voice repeating 'yeahs,' followed by a switch to a female singer for the main verses. For each chorus, the male 'yeahs' should come back in as a recurring element. Keep it energetic and catchy since it’s meant to stand out in public spaces like grocery stores."

Looking forward to seeing what you create!
