Lyrics :
[Verse]
In the heart of the night, we dance under the stars,
Your laughter's a melody, playing on my heartstrings.

[Chorus]
Baby, you're right, everything's alright when you're here,
With every breath you take, my love grows oh so clear.

[Breakdown]
Baby... (rising)
Baby, oh baby... (falling)
You're the rhythm in my heart, you're the stars in my night,
Baby... (softer, rising)
Oh baby, you're right... (falling)

[Bridge]
And if the world should stop and ask me why I'm smiling,
I'll show them your picture, tell them 'bout our wild times,
Together we'll conquer, together we'll rise,
With every sunset kiss, I fall for you more each time.
