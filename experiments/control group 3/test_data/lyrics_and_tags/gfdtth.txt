Lyrics :
[verse 1]
In the silence, shadows grow,
Whispers of a love long gone.
Memories linger, they won't let go,
In the night, where hearts are drawn.

[chorus]
Some say that the world is ending,
A symphony of despair we're sending.
Voices cry, in darkness blend,
Yearning for what we can't defend.

[verse 2]
Through empty halls, echoes play,
Ghosts of laughter from yesterday.
Each step I take, feels so astray,
Lost within this endless ballet.

[bridge]
Time stands still, yet flows like tears,
Bridging the gap of fleeting years.
In this moment, pain sears,
An operatic crescendo clears.

[chorus]
Some say that the world is ending,
A symphony of despair we're sending.
Voices cry, in darkness blend,
Yearning for what we can't defend.
