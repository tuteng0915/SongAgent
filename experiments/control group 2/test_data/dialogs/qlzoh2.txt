Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that fits a very specific vibe. I want it to feel like something from the early/mid 2000s, with a folksy acoustic style. The singer should have a raspy, unpolished voice, and the instrumentation should be minimal—just an acoustic guitar carrying most of the weight.

As for the lyrics, here are some themes I’d love incorporated:
- A strong sense of **nostalgia**, like looking back on simpler times.
- Some kind of reference to **Cuba** or even **Che Guevara**—something that evokes revolutionary spirit or just that cultural aesthetic.
- Mention of **guns**, maybe in a metaphorical way, or tied into the broader themes.
- Something about **sugar cane**—perhaps playing or laying in fields of it, symbolizing warmth, nature, or sweetness mixed with hardship.

Think you can whip up something based on these ideas? Let’s create this song together!

I have set the tags and lyrics for your song based on the themes and vibe you described. Here's a summary of what I've done:

- **Tags**: early 2000s, folksy acoustic, raspy voice, acoustic guitar, nostalgia, revolutionary spirit, Che Guevara, guns, sugar cane.
  
- **Lyrics**: The lyrics incorporate nostalgia, references to Cuba and Che Guevara, metaphorical mentions of guns, and vivid imagery of sugar cane fields.

Here is how the song is structured:

```
[verse]
Walking through fields of sugar cane
The sun beating down on my weary frame
I hear the echoes of simpler times
Of revolution and hope intertwined

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[verse]
Lying beneath the vast blue sky
Rustling leaves whisper as time goes by
Memories linger like sweet perfume
In the heart of Havana, where dreams resume

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[bridge]
Nostalgia grips me like an old friend
Taking me back to where it all began
Under the warmth of the Cuban sun
Where the battles were fought, but the war's not done

[chorus]
Oh, Che Guevara's eyes
Like a beacon in the Cuban skies
A gun in hand, but not to fight
A symbol of change under starless nights

[ending]
And so I wander through fields of green
Dreaming of what has been and what could've been
With every step, I feel the weight
Of history's path and love's freight
