Lyrics :
[verse]
Drops of rain fall on my skin 
Whispers of the ocean within 
Piano keys trace through the night 
A melody bathed in moonlight

[chorus]
Rivers run deep like my love for you 
Oceans overflow with dreams anew 
Rain will wash away the pain I knew 
In this endless dance of sky and blue

[verse]
Tides pull me where memories sleep 
Waves crash louder than they seem 
Each note a ripple in time's stream 
Carried softly by fateâ€™s regime

[chorus]
Rivers run deep like my love for you 
Oceans overflow with dreams anew 
Rain will wash away the pain I knew 
In this endless dance of sky and blue

[bridge]
And when the storm begins to clear 
The calmness brings us ever near 
Through every flood and every tear 
Water carries whispers we hear

[chorus]
Rivers run deep like my love for you 
Oceans overflow with dreams anew 
Rain will wash away the pain I knew 
In this endless dance of sky and blue

[outro]
Let the rain kiss you tonight 
Feel the ocean's arms hold tight 
As water flows under starlit skies 
We'll drift away where silence lies
