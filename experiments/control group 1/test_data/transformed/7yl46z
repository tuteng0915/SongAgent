Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches a specific vibe I have in mind. I'm looking for a slow, breezy 70’s style song with a gentle male voice, similar to Seals and Crofts. The song should feature light trumpets in the background and evoke that easygoing, nostalgic feel. 

I also want the word “ocean” included somewhere in the lyrics, and the final line of the song should be: *"I’m still in love with youuuuu..."* (with the drawn-out "you" at the end for emotional effect). 

Can you create something like this? It’s inspired by those classic hits from the 70s and 80s that everyone seems to know but can’t quite name. Let me know what you come up with!
