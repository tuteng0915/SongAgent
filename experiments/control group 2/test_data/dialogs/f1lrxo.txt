Hello, song generating agent! I need your help to create a song based on the following requirements:

I'm looking for a song with an emo/pop-punk sound, reminiscent of Fall Out Boy, from around 2007. The song should have a line about putting buckets on their heads to keep the zombies from eating their brains or something similar. Can you generate a song that meets these criteria?

I've generated a song with an emo/pop-punk sound reminiscent of Fall Out Boy from around 2007. The lyrics include a verse about putting buckets on heads to keep the zombies from eating brains, as you requested. Here's a snippet:

[verse]
I woke up with a bucket on my head
To keep the zombies from eating my brains
