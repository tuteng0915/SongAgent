Hello, song generating agent! I am looking to create a victorious-sounding rock/pop song that captures the energy and emotion of a sports victory scene in a movie. The song should feel modern, as if it could have been released by a band within the last 10 years.

Here are some specific features I'd like to include:
- The chorus should start with the singer belting out an energetic "OH" on the notes "G," "Ab," and "Eb."
- These "OH" vocals should be repeated several times throughout the chorus, harmonizing with powerful guitar riffs.
- The overall tone should be uplifting, triumphant, and motivationalâ€”perfect for celebrating a hard-fought victory.

Could you generate such a song for me? Please provide the lyrics and any relevant tags that fit this description. Thank you!
