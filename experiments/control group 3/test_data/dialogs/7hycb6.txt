Sure thing! Let's start by specifying the theme and mood of the song. How about we aim for a 'festive and modern' vibe to match the indie-style you're looking for? Does that sound good?
Agent : 
That sounds like a great starting point! To ensure we're on the same page, could you provide more details about what you envision for this 'festive and modern' indie-style song? For example, do you have any specific instruments in mind, or any particular artists or songs that inspire this vibe? Also, should the lyrics focus on any particular topic or emotion to enhance the festive mood?
User : 
Let's keep the focus on a brass or trumpet hook to make it catchy. And for the lyrics, how about we keep it light and joyful? Maybe talk about the excitement of the holiday season? Does that work for you?
Agent :
