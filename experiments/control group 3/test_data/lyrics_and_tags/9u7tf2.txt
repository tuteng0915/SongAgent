Lyrics :
[verse]
Strolling through the park, life was so serene
Then I saw my lover, exchanging secrets with a man in a trench coat, oh what a scene

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, my heart skips a beat
Turns out my darling's a spy, life's bittersweet

[verse]
Messages in bottles, and gadgets in her bag
Every rendezvous, feels like an action-packed saga tag

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, my heart skips a beat
Turns out my darling's a spy, life's bittersweet

[bridge]
Undercover escapades, every kiss a code
In this wild city, love's an enigma to behold

[chorus]
Jump up, jump up, my heart skips a beat
Turns out my darling's a spy, life's bittersweet
