Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows, I rise again
Through the dark, my heart's a weapon
[chorus]
I won't back down, no retreat
This is my fight, my heartbeat
[verse]
The night whispers secrets untold
But I walk this path, brave and bold
[chorus]
I won't back down, no retreat
This is my fight, my heartbeat
[bridge]
Defy the world, break the chain
In this moment, I'll feel no pain
[chorus]
I won't back down, no retreat
This is my fight, my heartbeat
