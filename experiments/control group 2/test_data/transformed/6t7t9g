Hey song agent! I need you to generate an upbeat, energetic country song in the style of Chris LeDoux, George Strait, or Garth Brooks from the 80s or early 90s. The theme should revolve around rodeos and cowboy life, capturing that classic Western vibe. One key lyric I’d like included is “Houston Dallas Austin and San Anton” — it can be part of a chorus or verse, but make sure it stands out. Keep the tempo faster and lively, something people could line dance to. Can you also include tags so I know what kind of mood and genre we're working with?

Let’s see what the agent comes up with!
