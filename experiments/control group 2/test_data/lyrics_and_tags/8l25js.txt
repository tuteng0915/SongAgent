Lyrics :
[verse]
I know, you've been through this before
But somehow, it feels different now

[chorus]
And I'll stand by you, as we walk through the storm
Together we'll find a place where we belong
Embrace the night, and surrender

[bridge]
The echoes of our past will fade away
In the arms of tomorrow, we'll find our way
