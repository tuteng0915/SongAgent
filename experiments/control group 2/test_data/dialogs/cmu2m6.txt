Hey there! I need your help to generate a song based on a scenario I have in mind. The song should be happy and funny, not serious at all. Itâ€™s about a man who discovers his girlfriend cheating on him with his neighbor or friend. In response, he goes out to the garden in his bathrobe, starts watering his flowers, and then hilariously destroys parts of his house or specific rooms. This song should feel like it couldâ€™ve been released between 2000 and 2005. Can you create something that fits this description?

[verse]
Woke up to see my girl wasn't there
Found a note that read "Your friend's got flair"
Neighbor's house lit up like the Fourth of July
But I'm just standing here with watering can in my hand

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[verse]
Took a sledgehammer to the kitchen wall
Paintings fell down like a comedy show
This heartbreak ainâ€™t so bad after all
'Cause now I've got a story no one will forget

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[bridge]
Oh, who needs love when youâ€™ve got tools?
Pots and pans make better fools
So grab your hammer, feel alive
Break some walls, letâ€™s survive!

[chorus]
Watering flowers, yeah, life goes on
Got my bathrobe on, and it's all wrong
I'll hose this garden till morning comes
And then I'll wreck the living room!

[outro]
By tomorrow night, I'll build a bar
Out of pieces of our old love car
Life's too short for being blue
So here's to revengeâ€”and plants too!
