Lyrics :
[verse]
In the garden of Eden, where shadows play,
She walks in whispers, beneath skies of gray.
A world so vivid, yet lost in time,
Dreams entwine her, like a gentle rhyme.

[chorus]
Oh Eden, your echoes linger on,
Through every heartbeat, through every dawn.
We dance in silence, to a timeless song,
Guided by the moonlight, where we belong.

[verse]
Crystal rivers reflect her glowing face,
A fleeting moment, frozen in space.
Her voice, a melody soft and clear,
Sings of hope amidst the fear.

[chorus]
Oh Eden, your echoes linger on,
Through every heartbeat, through every dawn.
We dance in silence, to a timeless song,
Guided by the moonlight, where we belong.

[bridge]
Between the trees, where light breaks free,
She finds her solace, she finds her plea.
The earth still hums its ancient tune,
Beneath the watchful eyes of the moon.

[chorus]
Oh Eden, your echoes linger on,
Through every heartbeat, through every dawn.
We dance in silence, to a timeless song,
Guided by the moonlight, where we belong.
