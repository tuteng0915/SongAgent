Lyrics :
[verse]
Pickup truck rolling down the dirt road,
Beer in my hand, got the radio on show,
The sun's setting fire to the evening sky,
Got my boots on, feeling so high.

[chorus]
It's a country rock night, with a spark in the air,
Heavy guitars blazing, we don't care,
Life's like a song, can't go wrong,
With a little bit of fire, and a whole lot of fun gone wild.

[verse]
Headlights shining bright as stars above,
Telling tall tales, yeah, that's what we love,
Smoke from the bonfire, dancing in the breeze,
Living life loud, just like we please.

[chorus]
It's a country rock night, with a spark in the air,
Heavy guitars blazing, we don't care,
Life's like a song, can't go wrong,
With a little bit of fire, and a whole lot of fun gone wild.

[bridge]
Oh, let's crank it up, let the night begin,
Feel that beat, deep within our skin,
Awfulness never felt so right,
Underneath the moonlight, everything's alright.

[chorus]
It's a country rock night, with a spark in the air,
Heavy guitars blazing, we don't care,
Life's like a song, can't go wrong,
With a little bit of fire, and a whole lot of fun gone wild.
