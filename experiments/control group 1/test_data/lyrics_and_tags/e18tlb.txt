Lyrics :
[verse]
I've been searching for a love that's true
But every time I find it, it slips away from me
[chorus]
Girlfriend, won't you stay with me tonight?
We can make the stars align in the sky
Girlfriend, let's run away to paradise
Together we'll ignite like fireworks in the night
[verse]
I've been feeling lost and all alone
But your touch brings me back to life again
[chorus]
Girlfriend, won't you stay with me tonight?
We can make the stars align in the sky
Girlfriend, let's run away to paradise
Together we'll ignite like fireworks in the night
[bridge]
In this world full of chaos and pain
You're the only one who can ease my brain
[chorus]
Girlfriend, won't you stay with me tonight?
We can make the stars align in the sky
Girlfriend, let's run away to paradise
Together we'll ignite like fireworks in the night
