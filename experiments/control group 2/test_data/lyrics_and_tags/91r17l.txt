Lyrics :
[verse]
In the heart of the night where the stage lights gleam,
A portal to the past in a timeless dream,
From jazzy steps to the beats so tight,
The rhythm takes us on a thrilling flight.

[chorus]
Feel the magic in the air tonight,
Dance through centuries under neon light,
Swing meets hip-hop in a dazzling fight,
We're the stars of this enchanted night.

[verse]
Under the glow where history's alive,
Retro vibes and modern souls collide,
In this theatre, every move's a story untold,
Eras clashing yet blending gold.

[bridge]
Every step a brushstroke painting time,
In this dance of shadows intertwining rhyme,
Together we rise as the music ignites,
A symphony of cultures bathed in moonlight.

[chorus]
Feel the magic in the air tonight,
Dance through centuries under neon light,
Swing meets hip-hop in a dazzling fight,
We're the stars of this enchanted night.

[outro]
As the curtain falls, the echoes remain,
An eternal celebration defying restraint,
On this glowing stage where legends ignite,
The spirit of dance carries us into the night.
