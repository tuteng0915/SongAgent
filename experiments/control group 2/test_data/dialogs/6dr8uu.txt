Hello, Song Agent! I'd like you to generate a song based on some specific requirements. The song should be in the style of an American pop song from the 90s or early 2000s. It should include a part where the singer overhears people gossiping in another room and angrily sings something about "doesn't anybody close their doors anymore." Can you create such a song for me? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!

I've crafted a song that fits your description. It's styled after an American pop song from the 90s or early 2000s, capturing the feeling of overhearing gossip and responding with emotion. The lyrics include the line you specified about closing doors.

Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
I heard them talking in the other room
Their whispers cut like a knife
Every word was like a poison
Spreading through my life

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[verse]
It's like they feed on dirty laundry
Hanging out for all to see
I try to block it out but it's everywhere
In every corner of this house

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[bridge]
I'm tired of living in a fishbowl
With everyone watching my every move
Can't we find a place where we can be free
Where our private lives are ours to keep

[chorus]
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
Keep your secrets behind closed doors
I don't wanna hear what they're saying
About me and you

[chorus]
Close those doors, keep it inside
Let's not let the world in on our lives
Doesn't anybody close their doors anymore
