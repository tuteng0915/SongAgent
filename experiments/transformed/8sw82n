Hey there! I’d like you to generate a song for me. Here’s what I’m thinking:  

It should be a recent pop song, maybe around two years old, with a female singer. The vibe is something like Halsey—moody, emotional, but still catchy.  

The theme of the song is about being at a club or party and feeling out of place. The narrator is faking having fun while secretly wishing they were somewhere else. It’s introspective and relatable, with that mix of vulnerability and energy.  

Can you create something based on this?
