Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches some specific details. Here's what I'm looking for:

I want an alt-rock song with a really unique and trippy vibe, something that could have been made in the early 2000s. The lyrics should evoke imagery of a Victorian-style character, maybe someone eccentric or mysterious, surrounded by surreal floating objectsâ€”perhaps sheep or other whimsical things. The overall mood should feel dreamlike, slightly weird, but still captivating.

Can you create something based on this concept?
