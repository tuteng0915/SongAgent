Lyrics :
[verse]
In the quiet of the night, I wander through my mind
A dreamscape unfolds, where shadows gently collide

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie

[verse]
Echoes of memories, in the silence they sing
Guiding me gently, through this journey within

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie

[bridge]
In this ethereal dance, time fades away
Only the moment remains, in this introspective ballet

[chorus]
Floating on whispers of time, lost in a serene sky
Where thoughts drift like stars, and softly they lie
