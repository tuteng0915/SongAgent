Sure thing! Let's start by crafting that synth intro you mentioned. How long would you like the intro to be?
Agent : 
That sounds exciting! For a synth intro, a common choice is to have it around 15-30 seconds long. This gives enough time to build atmosphere and set the stage for the rest of the song. If you don't have a specific length in mind, let's go with a 20-second intro. 

I'll set the tags to reflect a synth-driven, atmospheric intro. Let me adjust the parameters accordingly.


Successfully set the parameter tags
The tags have been set for a synth-driven, atmospheric intro. Now, let's generate the actual intro segment.

I'll create a simple structure for the intro with some placeholder lyrics (though they might not be used if the intro is instrumental). 

Here's a proposed structure:

[Intro]
Synth fades in gently,
Setting the stage for what's to come,
A journey of sound begins...
