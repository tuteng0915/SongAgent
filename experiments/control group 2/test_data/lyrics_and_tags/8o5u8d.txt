Lyrics :
[verse]
Zombies in the backyard going crazy,
Dancing to the rhythm like they're lazy.
Apocalypse now, but we still party,
End of the world, but we ain't stopping.

[chorus]
The sky is falling, but we laugh it off,
Quirky tunes playing, as we all go soft.
Humor saves the day when doom knocks,
We'll sing along while Rome still rocks.

[bridge]
Oh, you had triplets instead of twins?
Your pork tastes like chicken, where's the sins?
Robot voices echo, future's so thin,
In this wild world, let the fun begin.

[chorus]
The sky is falling, but we laugh it off,
Quirky tunes playing, as we all go soft.
Humor saves the day when doom knocks,
We'll sing along while Rome still rocks.
