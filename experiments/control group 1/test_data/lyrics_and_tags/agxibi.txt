Lyrics :
[verse]
Yo, waking up every day with a purpose to grind
City streets echoing stories untold
In the heart of the struggle where legends are born
Hustle on my mind like a beat that's worn

[chorus]
Rising from the ashes, reaching for the sky
Dreams might be distant but I won't say die
Step by step, paving my way
With hope as my weapon, I'll win the day

[verse]
Facing obstacles head-on, no fear in sight
Shadows fall but I shine that much brighter
Voices may doubt, but I turn up the sound
Fueling my fire, in this battle unbound

[chorus]
Rising from the ashes, reaching for the sky
Dreams might be distant but I won't say die
Step by step, paving my way
With hope as my weapon, I'll win the day

[bridge]
Every setback's a setup for a major comeback
In the story of life, I'm the one who's intact
Got the world on my shoulders, still standing tall
Echoes of triumph, breaking through these walls

[chorus]
Rising from the ashes, reaching for the sky
Dreams might be distant but I won't say die
Step by step, paving my way
With hope as my weapon, I'll win the day
