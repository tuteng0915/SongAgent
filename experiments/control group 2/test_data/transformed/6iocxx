Hello, song generating agent! I have a fun challenge for you. I'd like you to generate a song based on the following details:

- The style should be similar to Ricky Martin, so think upbeat, Latin pop with a catchy rhythm.
- The lyrics should revolve around the theme of love, specifically a man who doesn't have much but is willing to give his heart to the girl he loves.
- Include imagery of a beach scene with a hammock, and mention a Volkswagen bus somewhere in the lyrics or as part of the story being told.
- The song should evoke the feeling of a group of friends gathered around a fire, playing instruments together, perhaps with a lively, acoustic finale.

Can you create a song that fits these criteria? I'm excited to hear what you come up with!
