Lyrics :
[verse]
Under the sun where the sea breeze plays,
In a hammock by the beach, he sways.
With not much to give but his heart so true,
He dreams of her smile, every moment anew.

[chorus]
Oh girl, you're my sunrise and sunset,
In this old Volkswagen, we've just met.
The rhythm of the waves, the beat of my heart,
Together in this journey, never to part.

[verse]
The sand beneath us, stars up above,
Every simple thing is a gift, with love.
His guitar softly strums through the night,
A melody of passion under starlight.

[chorus]
Oh girl, you're my sunrise and sunset,
In this old Volkswagen, we've just met.
The rhythm of the waves, the beat of my heart,
Together in this journey, never to part.

[bridge]
Through highs and lows, our spirits align,
With nothing but the moon to light our path divine.
In each other's arms, we find our escape,
A paradise found, no need for shape.

[finale]
Gather 'round friends, let the fire ignite,
Pass the cajón, let’s jam through the night.
Acoustic strings, laughter fills the air,
In this circle of joy, everyone's a millionaire.

[chorus]
Oh girl, you're my sunrise and sunset,
In this old Volkswagen, we've just met.
The rhythm of the waves, the beat of my heart,
Together in this journey, never to part.
