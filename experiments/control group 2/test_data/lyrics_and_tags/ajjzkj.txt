Lyrics :
[verse]
Rollin' through the city streets
Skateboard dancing to the funky beats
Sunshine gleaming, wheels in spin
Urban jungle, let the games begin

[chorus]
Ride that board, feel so free
Quirky moves in harmony
Life's a cartoon, bold and bright
Funky visuals, taking flight

[verse]
Neon colors, graffiti walls
Animation blending as he calls
Each trick a story, each ride a scene
Vibrant dreams on skateboard machines

[chorus]
Ride that board, feel so free
Quirky moves in harmony
Life's a cartoon, bold and bright
Funky visuals, taking flight

[bridge]
Flip and glide, don't miss a beat
Energy surging from head to feet
Reality bends, imagination blends
In this world where fun never ends

[chorus]
Ride that board, feel so free
Quirky moves in harmony
Life's a cartoon, bold and bright
Funky visuals, taking flight
