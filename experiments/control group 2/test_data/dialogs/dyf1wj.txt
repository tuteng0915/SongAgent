Request to the Song Agent:  
I’d like you to generate a fun, poppy song with folky undertones inspired by the style of music that was popular around 2008. The song should tell a story about a wolf or someone who is born with fur, and it should be sung from the perspective of a young male singer. The lyrics should include some key phrases like “now my friends do not know,” “my body’s covered in fur,” or “you can wear my fur.” It’s important that the tone stays lighthearted and fun despite the quirky subject matter. The song could follow the narrative arc of growing up as a wolf-like person, meeting someone special, and navigating life with this unique trait. Please also tag the song appropriately so I can get a sense of its vibe and themes. Thank you!

```
[verse 1]
I was born under a strange old moon,
With fur that grew since I was in the womb.
Now my friends do not know,
What it's like to be so alone.

[chorus]
But I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll improvise.

[verse 2]
Through the woods, we'd run free,
Howling songs of sweet melody.
And though they'd laugh at school,
I found love that made me feel cool.

[chorus]
But I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll improvise.

[bridge]
Oh, the years have been kind,
To this heart that they could never define.
Together we'll roam, through fields far and wide,
With you by my side, there's nothing to hide.

[chorus]
'Cause I'm not afraid, no, I won't hide,
My body’s covered in fur, and that's alright!
Dance with me under starry skies,
You can wear my fur, we'll harmonize.

[outro]
So here's to the wolf who dances in me,
The one that set my spirit free.
