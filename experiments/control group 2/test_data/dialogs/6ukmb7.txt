Hello, song generating agent! I have a request for you to create a song that fits the following description:

The genre could be rock, blues rock, or even Motown. The song should feature a chorus with several people singing "...doin' all right..." with a short instrumental interlude followed shortly by the same phrase again "...doin' all right...".

Additionally, there may or may not be another lyric in the song that's either "...write me a letter..." or "...write you a letter...".

I'm excited to hear what you come up with! Let's generate this song together.

I've set up the song with a blend of rock, blues rock, and Motown influences. The lyrics include a vibrant chorus with group vocals singing "...doin' all right...", followed by an instrumental interlude, and then the phrase "...doin' all right..." repeats. Additionally, I've included a verse with the lyric "...write me a letter...".

Now that we have our tags and lyrics ready, please press the "generate" button to create the song.
