User : 
Hey there! I'm looking to generate a song that fits a specific vibe. I want it to have a late 80s to early 90s rock feel, but not the arena or hair band styleâ€”more of a classic American rock sound with a slightly poppy twist. The key feature of the song is a breakdown section where the word "baby" is repeated over and over in a rising and falling scale. It would be great if the scale goes through a couple of times and possibly ends with the word "right." Can you help me craft something like that?

I've set up the song based on your preferences for a late 80s to early 90s classic American rock sound with a poppy twist. The breakdown section includes the word "baby" repeated in a rising and falling scale, ending with "right." 

Here's how the lyrics look:

```
[verse]
Baby take my hand
We'll walk through this land
Where shadows fall and time stands still

[chorus]
Oh baby, baby, won't you stay
Baby, baby, here with me today

[breakdown]
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby (rising scale)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby (falling scale)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby right (ending)
```
