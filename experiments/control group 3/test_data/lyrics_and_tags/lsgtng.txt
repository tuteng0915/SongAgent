Lyrics :
[verse]
She pulls away, tires hum with goodbye
In the rearview mirror, his heart's in her sigh
A silent love lost to time's cruel play
Regret rides shotgun on this lonely highway

[chorus]
Oh Emily, your name lingers in the air
Unspoken words, a quiet regret too heavy to bear
Underneath the sky where dreams drift apart
Two hearts silently breaking under the stars

[verse]
Beside him stands another, with love in her eyes unseen
Her silence a mirror of what could've been
Secrets kept safe, yet yearning to break free
In this tragic dance of might-have-beens

[chorus]
Oh Emily, your name lingers in the air
Unspoken words, a quiet regret too heavy to bear
Underneath the sky where dreams drift apart
Two hearts silently breaking under the stars

[bridge]
If only whispers could turn into sound
And courage find its way from shadows profound
Would they still stand frozen in their private despair
Or find solace in confessions laid bare

[chorus]
Oh Emily, your name lingers in the air
Unspoken words, a quiet regret too heavy to bear
Underneath the sky where dreams drift apart
Two hearts silently breaking under the stars
