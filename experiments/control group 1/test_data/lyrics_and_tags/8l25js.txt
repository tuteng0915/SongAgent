Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of our laughter
I find the ghosts of love long after
The sun sets in hues of gray
And I'm left with yesterday

[chorus]
Oh, the silence speaks your name
In every shadow, in every flame
I reach out but you're not there
Lost in the whispers of the air

[verse]
The photographs fade to sepia
Memories blur like lines in water
Your voice is a distant song
That lingers where shadows belong

[chorus]
Oh, the silence speaks your name
In every shadow, in every flame
I reach out but you're not there
Lost in the whispers of the air

[bridge]
Time moves on, seasons change
But my heart remains in that frame
Where your smile was my sunrise
And your touch, my paradise

[chorus]
Oh, the silence speaks your name
In every shadow, in every flame
I reach out but you're not there
Lost in the whispers of the air

[outro]
Now I wander through empty halls
Hearing echoes of our calls
Forever searching for your light
In the solitude of night
