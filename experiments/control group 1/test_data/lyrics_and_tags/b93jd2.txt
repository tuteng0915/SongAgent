Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows where the devils dance
Woo Woo, hear them chant
Through the night, they take a chance
Woo Woo, in a trance

[chorus]
Dance with the devil under the moonlight glow
Woo Woo, let the rhythm flow
Dance with the devil, feel the fire burn
Woo Woo, it's our turn

[bridge]
The night is young, but the clock's ticking
Devil's tunes got us all picking
Up the beat, can't resist tricking
Woo Woo, keep on sticking

[chorus]
Dance with the devil under the moonlight glow
Woo Woo, let the rhythm flow
Dance with the devil, feel the fire burn
Woo Woo, it's our turn
