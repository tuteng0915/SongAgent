Sure thing! Let's start by specifying a title for the song. How about something bold and energetic like "Racing Through the Night"? Does that work for you?
Agent : 
That sounds like a fantastic title! "Racing Through the Night" gives us a great starting point. To make sure we're on the same page, let's decide on a few more details:

1. What genre would you like this song to be? (e.g., rock, pop, electronic)
2. Do you have any specific themes or emotions in mind for the lyrics?
3. Should the tempo be fast-paced to match the title, or something more laid-back?

Once I have these details, I can generate some tags and draft the initial structure of the lyrics. Let me know what direction you'd like to take!
User : 
Great! How about we go with a rock genre? It seems fitting for a fast-paced song. As for themes, maybe something about freedom and adventure? And yes, let's keep the tempo fast to match the energetic title. Does that sound good?

Great choices! We’re going with a rock genre, focusing on themes of freedom and adventure, and keeping the tempo fast-paced to match the energetic title. I’ve set the tags for the song as: rock, fast-paced, freedom, adventure, and energetic.

Now let’s draft the initial structure of the lyrics. Here's a suggestion:

[Verse]
Racing through the night, chasing dreams in flight
Wheels spinning fast, breaking every chain at last

[Chorus]
Free as the wind, we'll never give in
Underneath the sky, where adventures never die
Feel alive, hearts pounding strong
In this journey, we belong

[Bridge]
Onward through shadows, past city lights
Bound by courage, fueled by fire inside

[Chorus]
Free as the wind, we'll never give in
Underneath the sky, where adventures never die
Feel alive, hearts pounding strong
In this journey, we belong
