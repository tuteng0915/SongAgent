Lyrics :
[verse 1]
At the lonely station, shadows creep,
A woman meets a girl, in the night so deep,
With a toy once loved, now a sinister keep,
The bond they forge is an eerie steep.

[chorus]
Oh, the ties that twist, in darkness enlist,
No escape from this chilling mist,
The game she plays, with dolls in disarray,
In this false role, her soul pays the toll.

[verse 2]
Beneath the moon's gaze, cold and stark,
The laughter of the girl leaves an indelible mark,
Entrapped in a charade, no exit in chart,
Her fate entwined with a child's haunted heart.

[bridge]
In the soil she digs, a lullaby she sings,
A dirge for herself, as death tightly clings,
The shovel bites deep, her fate she carves,
In the silence, despair, her own grave she garns.

[ending]
As the morning light breaks, the world awakes,
Yet one lies silent, her story opaque,
The echoes linger, where shadows embrace,
And whispers warn of the dark, forgotten place.
