Sure thing! Let's get started on crafting that song. I'll kick things off by asking the agent for a moody yet catchy pop song with a female singer, along the lines of Halsey. The theme will be about feeling out of place at a club or party.

I’ll start by requesting:  
"I want a recent moody pop song with a female vocalist—something introspective but still has energy. Think Halsey vibes."

Alright, we've set up the song with a moody pop vibe, featuring a female vocalist, and an introspective yet energetic theme inspired by Halsey. Here's how the lyrics look:

[verse]  
I walk in, lights flash, but I'm out of sync  
Heads turn, but I feel like I'm on the brink  

[chorus]  
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still  
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill  
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in  
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?  

[verse]  
Neon signs blur, shadows whisper my name  
The beat is electric, but it feels so tame  

[chorus]  
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still  
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill  
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in  
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?  

[bridge]  
Maybe someday, I'll find my place  
But tonight, I'm just a ghost in this space  

[chorus]  
Everybody's dancing, but I stand still  
Caught in a moment, can't shake this chill  
It's not where I belong, though I try to fit in  
Lost in the echoes, where do I begin?
