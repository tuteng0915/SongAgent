Lyrics :
[verse]
And it's a running-and-a-jumping-and-a-moving-and-a-grooving
And a stopping-and-popping-and-yelling-and-a-dropping-and-a
Flipping over barriers and sliding under gates
Climbing up the walls and leaping through the flames

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack

[verse]
Dodging every obstacle with quick precision
Dancing through the chaos with a funky rhythm
Basslines deep and vocals sharp as steel
In this urban jungle, we make our own deal

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack

[bridge]
Rolling with the punches, spinning like a top
Every move we make is synced to the clock
British or American, accents don't matter
As long as we keep moving faster and faster

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack
