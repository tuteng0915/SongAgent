[Intro]
Sound Effects (rhythmic)

[Verse 1]
Caught in the haze of a shadowed past,
Needle's whisper, a kiss that doesn't last.
Chasing highs in the dead of night,
In the arms of fleeting pleasure, out of sight.

[Chorus]
Drowning deep in the venom's embrace,
Lost within this endless chase.
Can't break free from this cruel charade,
Heroin dreams that never fade.

[Verse 2]
Cold sweat dripping as morning breaks,
The mirror shows a soul that quakes.
Voices echo through an empty room,
Haunted by memories and impending doom.

[Bridge]
But thereâ€™s a spark amidst the despair,
A chance to fight back, to show you care.
Rebuild the ruins, mend your ways,
Seek the truth behind the haze.

[Chorus]
Drowning deep in the venom's embrace,
Lost within this endless chase.
Can't break free from this cruel charade,
Heroin dreams that never fade.

[Outro]
