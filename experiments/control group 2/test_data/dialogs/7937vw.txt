Hey, song agent! I need you to generate a melancholy song that fits this vibe: it's like something out of those nineties movies where a character realizes they've made a terrible mistake. The singer should draw out the word "change" in a way that almost sounds like "chains," emphasizing the H sound when singing "Cha Ha Change." Itâ€™s moody, reflective, and full of regret. Can you create something with that atmosphere?

I've set the stage for your melancholy song, capturing that 90s movie vibe full of regret and reflection. The lyrics emphasize the drawn-out "Cha Ha Change" to mimic the sound of "chains," symbolizing the weight of past mistakes.

Here's a snippet of the song we've created:

```
[verse]
I walked a lonely road
Regretting every step I've known
The echoes of the past remain
In shadows, they eternally stay

[chorus]
Oh Cha Ha Change
It's just a cruel refrain
Bound by these chains
Of choices left in the rain

[verse]
The weight upon my chest
A heavy stone, I can't contest
Memories linger like a stain
In the theater of my pain

[chorus]
Oh Cha Ha Change
A haunting serenade
Bound by these chains
Where silence and sorrow are lain
```
