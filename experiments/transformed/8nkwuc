Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that captures the essence of an older g-funk/rap/hip-hop track from the 90s or later, something with vibes similar to “Forgot About Dre.” The beat should have that classic West Coast bounce—smooth, funky, and heavy on the synth basslines, with some crisp hi-hats and maybe even a sample or two for nostalgia.

For the chorus, I envision a female vocalist delivering something catchy and soulful, almost like a hook you can’t get out of your head. It could be along the lines of "It's the boogie woogie yeahhh" or "It's the something of them aaaallll," but feel free to interpret it however fits best musically. Think big, bold, and anthemic—a moment where the energy just explodes.

This needs to slap hard, so let’s make sure it’s got that larger-than-life vibe throughout. Let me know if you need more details, but otherwise, let’s create this banger!
