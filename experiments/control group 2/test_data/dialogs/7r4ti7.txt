Request to the Song Generating Agent:  

I’d like you to generate a song that matches the following description. The genre should be pop/rock/alternative, ideally with a male singer—possibly British or American. The tone of the song should reflect an emotional narrative arc: starting with urgency and concern, transitioning into happiness and love, then shifting toward tension, manipulation, and heartbreak, and finally ending on a haunting, cyclical note.  

The lyrics should tell this story:  
- It begins with a man encountering a woman who is in distress—he finds her on a rooftop about to jump after her shoe falls down. He intervenes and saves her.  
- They start a relationship, which starts off beautifully but becomes complicated as she grows possessive, manipulative, and emotionally volatile.  
- Eventually, they fight and break up, leaving both parties broken.  
- In the end, the woman returns to the same rooftop, now looking down at another person below, repeating the same action by dropping her shoe again, hinting at a tragic cycle.  

Can you create something that captures these themes while staying within the style I mentioned?

Here are the lyrics:

**[verse]**  
On the rooftop edge tonight  
She teeters close, her soul in flight  
Her shoe slips off and falls like fate  
I race to save her; it's not too late  

**[chorus]**  
In your eyes I saw the start  
Of a journey, hand to heart  
But now those stars have turned to scars  
A love torn by cruel wars  

**[verse]**  
Together we laughed, we danced, we burned  
But the fire that warmed us soon concerned  
Your touch, once tender, grew tight with pain  
Possessive whispers like pouring rain  

**[bridge]**  
You held my world but wouldn't let go  
Strings of your making pulled me low  
The fights, the tears, the endless nights  
Our love dissolved into dark spite  

**[chorus]**  
In your eyes I saw the start  
Of a journey, hand to heart  
But now those stars have turned to scars  
A love torn by cruel wars  

**[verse]**  
Back on the rooftop, the air so cold  
Another shoe drops, the story retold  
Below, someone looks up in despair  
And reaches out for the help you won't spare  

**[outro]**  
Oh, the cycle spins, it never ends  
A tragic loop that love pretends  
To heal, to mend—but brings us down  
Forever lost as fates revolve around
