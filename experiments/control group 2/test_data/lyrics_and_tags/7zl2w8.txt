Lyrics :
[intro]
"I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus."
"Could you describe the ruckus?"

[verse 1]
Chaos reigns, the world's undone,
Echoes scream when all is said,
Voices clash, the battle's won,
In the eye of storm, we tread.

[chorus]
Ruckus in the night, thunder shakes the ground,
Fury in the air, where silence used to be found.
Scream it out loud, let the chaos take its crown,
This is our war cry, hear the shadows drown.

[verse 2]
Concrete cracks beneath our feet,
Rising flames consume the skies,
Shadows dance, the end repeats,
Through the fire, truth never dies.

[chorus]
Ruckus in the night, thunder shakes the ground,
Fury in the air, where silence used to be found.
Scream it out loud, let the chaos take its crown,
This is our war cry, hear the shadows drown.

[bridge]
The calm before the storm will break,
And when it does, we'll rise again,
With every heartbeat, with every step,
The ruckus grows, feel no disdain.

[chorus]
Ruckus in the night, thunder shakes the ground,
Fury in the air, where silence used to be found.
Scream it out loud, let the chaos take its crown,
This is our war cry, hear the shadows drown.

[outro]
In this raw world, the ruckus will remain,
Our voices echo through the pain.
