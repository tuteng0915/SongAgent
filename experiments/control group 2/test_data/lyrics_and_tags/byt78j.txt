Lyrics :
[verse]
Falling through the haze
Lost in a fleeting daze

[chorus]
... to take the pain away ...
... to take the pain away ...

[verse]
Shadows softly fade
In this endless cascade

[chorus]
... to take the pain away ...
... to take the pain away ...

[bridge]
Dreams dissolve in gray
Echoes drift then they stay

[chorus]
... to take the pain away ...
... to take the pain away ...
