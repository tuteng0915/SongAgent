User : 
I'm looking for a punk/alternative song that starts soft and emotional, then builds up to something louder. It's about a father singing to his son about the son's mother who has passed away. Can you work with that?

[verse]
Daddy's here, little one, don't you cry
I know you miss her, I do too, every night

[chorus]
But we'll be okay, you and me
We'll make it through, just wait and see

[bridge]
She's watching over us from above
Her love will guide us, my dear son

[chorus]
But we'll be okay, you and me
We'll make it through, just wait and see

[ending]
Together we stand, hand in hand
With her love, we'll make our final stand
