Hey there! I need your help to generate a song. Here's what I'm thinking:  

It should be by a band, not a solo artist, with a rock/pop vibe—definitely not a ballad, but also not too fast. The theme of the song is about unrequited love, where the guy feels like he’s stuck in the friendzone. He’s pouring out his feelings while the girl remains oblivious to them, almost like she doesn’t see or understand how much he cares for her. It’s kind of bittersweet and has that "big friendzone energy."  

Can you create something based on this idea? Let me know what you come up with!
