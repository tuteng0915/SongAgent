Lyrics :
[verse]
We set out on this journey, hearts open wide
Every step we take, with love as our guide

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold

[verse]
The path may twist, the night may fall
But with you by my side, I'll never stall

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold

[bridge]
Hand in hand, we brave the unknown
With every heartbeat, our love has grown

[chorus]
Together we'll wander, through fields of gold
In this tale of ours, where dreams unfold
