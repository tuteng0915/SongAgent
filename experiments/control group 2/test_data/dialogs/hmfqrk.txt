Request to the Song Generating Agent:

I need you to generate a song that captures the essence of an action-packed sequence, something that could have been featured in movies, trailers, or YouTube videos from the 1990s-2000s. The song should have a fast-paced lyrical delivery reminiscent of the Beastie Boys, but with a deeper vocal tone and a funky bassline. The vocalist should either have a British accent or a twangy American drawl.

The lyrics should convey movement and energy, capturing the spirit of parkour or high-energy action scenes. Think along the lines of rapid-fire descriptions of running, jumping, moving, grooving, stopping, popping, yelling, and dropping—all in a rhythmic, driving manner.

Here’s a snippet of what the lyrical style might sound like:
"And, it's, a, running-and-a-jumping-and-a-moving-and-a-grooving-and-a-stopping-and-popping-and-yelling-and-a-dropping-and-a..."

Generate this song for me so I can finally hear the track that’s been stuck in my head for years!

Lyrics:
```
[verse]
And it's a running-and-a-jumping-and-a-moving-and-a-grooving
And a stopping-and-popping-and-yelling-and-a-dropping-and-a
Flipping over barriers and sliding under gates
Climbing up the walls and leaping through the flames

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack

[verse]
Dodging every obstacle with quick precision
Dancing through the chaos with a funky rhythm
Basslines deep and vocals sharp as steel
In this urban jungle, we make our own deal

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack

[bridge]
Rolling with the punches, spinning like a top
Every move we make is synced to the clock
British or American, accents don't matter
As long as we keep moving faster and faster

[chorus]
We're breaking all the rules, no time to slow down
Feel the adrenaline rush as we hit the ground
Parkour in the city streets, never looking back
With our feet on the beat, we're always on the attack
