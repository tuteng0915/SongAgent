Lyrics :
[verse]
In the shadows where we play,
Hearts collide in a deadly ballet.
Electric touch, it lights my way,
But I know I can't let it stay.

[chorus]
Dancing on the edge of desire,
Love's a fire, burning higher.
Caught in a rhythm so dire,
Can't escape this sweet empire.

[verse]
Every beat pulls me under,
Your spellbinding voice like thunder.
I'm addicted to the danger,
Lost in this enchanting slander.

[chorus]
Dancing on the edge of desire,
Love's a fire, burning higher.
Caught in a rhythm so dire,
Can't escape this sweet empire.

[bridge]
Swing me gently into your snare,
Electronic whispers fill the air.
Clones appear without a care,
Multiplying everywhere.
Fading slowly, lost in prayer,
A dazzling fall beyond compare.

[final chorus]
Dancing on the edge of desire,
Amongst the clones, I'm spiraling higher.
Caught in a rhythm that won't retire,
In this mirrored empire.
