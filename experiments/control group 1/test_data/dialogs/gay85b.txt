I need a song that's alternative or alternative rock, with a theme about a city that's ending in a year. Can you work with that?

I've crafted a song that fits your description. It's tagged with "alternative, alternative rock, city, ending, year" to match the theme you're looking for. Here are the lyrics:

[verse]
In the shadow of the skyline
Where the streetlights hum with secrets untold
We walk together, hearts adrift
On boulevards where dreams grow old

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[verse]
Concrete towers whisper warnings
Of the reckoning that draws near
Skyscrapers stand like ancient sentinels
Guarding memories we hold dear

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[bridge]
The countdown echoes through the night
Each chime a reminder of our fleeting time
But in these streets, love will ignite
A spark that outlasts the end of rhyme

[chorus]
This city's got a year to live
Clocks are ticking, can't you feel it?
Neon tears begin to spill
As we dance beneath the final curtain

[outro]
And when the last bell tolls its knell
Our love story in stars will dwell
