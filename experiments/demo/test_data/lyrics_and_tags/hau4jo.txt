Lyrics :
[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
In a world that tries to pull them apart, their hearts still hold on
Through the chaos and the city lights, they've found their secret code
Romeo and Juliet, a love that will never let go

[verse 1]
Juliet writes her dreams in a text so sweet
But her father's watchful eyes, make her heartbeat skip a beat
Every message scrutinized, every word a mystery
Yet through the digital maze, her love finds its way discreetly

[pre-chorus]
They find signals in silence, whispers in the noise
A modern tale of two souls, with a love that never cloys

[chorus]
Romeo is feelin' Juliet and Juliet's feelin' Romeo
In a world that tries to pull them apart, their hearts still hold on
Through the chaos and the city lights, they've found their secret code
Romeo and Juliet, a love that will never let go

[verse 2]
Romeo walks the streets, under neon skies
His phone buzzes softly, as he reads her goodnight sighs
In the shadows of the alleys, where secrets often hide
Their connection grows stronger, with every moment they confide
