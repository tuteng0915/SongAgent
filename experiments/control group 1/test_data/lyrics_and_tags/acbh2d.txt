Lyrics :
[verse]
Racing through the night
Chasing dreams with all my might
Heartbeat like a drum
Pounding fast, can't be undone

[chorus]
We are unstoppable, we'll never fall
Unbreakable, we'll never stall
We are unstoppable, hear our call
Together we stand tall

[verse]
Faster than the wind
Onward to the bitter end
Metal in our veins
Feel the power, break the chains

[chorus]
We are unstoppable, we'll never fall
Unbreakable, we'll never stall
We are unstoppable, hear our call
Together we stand tall

[bridge]
Through the fire, through the pain
We'll keep pushing, we'll maintain
In this fight, we won't abstain
Our spirit will remain

[chorus]
We are unstoppable, we'll never fall
Unbreakable, we'll never stall
We are unstoppable, hear our call
Together we stand tall
