Lyrics :
[verse]
In the silence of the night,
I find my way to the light,
It's a journey through the haze,
To escape, to drift away.

[chorus]
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.

[verse]
Whispers softly through the air,
A gentle touch, a fleeting care,
In the echoes of the day,
We search, we yearn, we sway.

[chorus]
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
... to take the pain away.
