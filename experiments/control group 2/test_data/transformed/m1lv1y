Hello, song generating agent! I'd like you to create a song for me that has the following features:

- The song should have an 80s vibe with a female singer.
- It should include dramatic "shouting" vocals, similar to Bonnie Tyler's raspy style.
- The overall sound of the song should resemble the chorus of "Love Is a Battlefield."
- The lyrics should contain the phrases "playing with fire" in the first verse and "I'm gonna give you my heart" during the chorus.

Please generate this song for me. Thank you!
