Sure thing! Let's start by narrowing down a few details. What kind of theme or story do you want the song to tell? Love, heartbreak, friendship, or something else?
Agent : 
Great! Themes are a good starting point. Besides the theme, could you also tell me about the mood or emotion you want the song to convey? Should it be uplifting and joyful, or more introspective and mellow? And do you have any preferences for the genre or style of the music?
User : 
Let's focus on a theme of friendship with a mood that's uplifting and joyful. For the genre, I'm thinking something like a classic pop ballad. How does that sound?

[verse]
We've walked together down these streets
In every weather, love never retreats

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away

[verse]
Countless memories light up our days
With you, life's a joyous parade

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away

[bridge]
Like a songbird singing in the morning dew
Our hearts keep the rhythm, fresh and new

[chorus]
Side by side, we'll always stay
Through the laughter and tears, come what may
Our friendship's a melody that never fades away
