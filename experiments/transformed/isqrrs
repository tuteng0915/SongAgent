Hello, Song Agent! I have a unique song in mind that I'd love for you to generate. I'm looking for a hauntingly beautiful and melancholic love song. The concept is quite poeticâ€”a couple finds themselves on a bus, and amidst the ordinary hum of daily life, they imagine their future together. The songwriter dreams of marrying his lover right there on the bus, with the passengers serving as their impromptu witnesses. Can you create a song that captures this tender yet bittersweet moment? Let's bring this vision to life!
