Lyrics :
[verse]
Walking down the old road,
With worn-out shoes that hurt so,
Every step a silent ode,
To treasures found amidst the dirt and flaws.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your strength never fades,
Through every storm, through every shade,
Finding gems where no one dares to look,
A testament to love, in the stories that you took.

[verse]
In the whispers of the wind,
I hear your gentle voice again,
Guiding me through paths untold,
With lessons stitched in threads of gold.

[chorus]
Oh mother, your strength never fades,
Through every storm, through every shade,
Finding gems where no one dares to look,
A testament to love, in the stories that you took.

[bridge]
The world may be cruel, unforgiving and vast,
But within your arms, I was always home at last,
Though the journey was tough, and the nights were long,
In your eyes, I saw where I truly belong.
