I need a song that captures the fun, flirty, and energetic vibe of a chaotic laundromat dance party. Can you start by giving me something with an upbeat pop rhythm?

Sure, I can help with that. Before we proceed, could you please specify any particular themes or elements you want in the lyrics? For instance, do you want any specific mentions of laundry items, dance moves, or anything else that could make the song more personalized and fun?
User : 
Let's keep it fun and flirty, maybe mention dancing and a bit of mischief. Oh, and don't forget the laundromat setting!

I've set up the lyrics and tags for your fun, flirty, and energetic laundromat dance party song. Here's a preview of the lyrics:

[verse]
Spinning round in a sudsy dream
Dance floor magic in a laundry scene
Jeans and shirts they twirl and sway
In this chaotic wash and play

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone

[verse]
Sneaky glances as clothes tumble dry
Secret whispers beneath the sky
Laughter echoes as quarters chime
In this wild dance against time

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone

[bridge]
Spin cycle grooves, rinse and repeat
Every moment feels so bittersweet
Caught in the rhythm, lost in the spin
Laundromat nights where love might begin

[chorus]
We're dancing in the laundromat tonight
With bubbles, suds, and everything just right
A little mischief, a lot of fun
Underneath the neon, we come undone
