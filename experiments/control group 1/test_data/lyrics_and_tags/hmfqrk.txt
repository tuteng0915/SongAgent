Lyrics :
[verse]
Racing through the city lights, chasing shadows in the night
Every heartbeat's like a drum, gotta keep it running till we're done
[chorus]
We're living on the edge, where the wild things dance
Feel the rhythm in your soul, let the groove enhance
Got our feet on the ground, but our heads in the stars
With a funky bassline leading, we'll go cruising in our cars
[bridge]
Turn it up, feel the heat, let the music set you free
In this world of fast pursuits, we find our destiny
[chorus]
