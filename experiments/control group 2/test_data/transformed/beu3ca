Hey there! I need your help to generate a song that matches a specific vibe I've been obsessing over. Picture this: it's a high-pitched, slow-tempo song sung by a female vocalist. There’s one line in the lyrics something like "look up, the sky is up above," and another part with drawn-out, almost chanting "heya heya heya ha" vocals. Can you create something like that for me? I'd love it to have a dreamy, reflective feel. Let’s make some magic happen!
