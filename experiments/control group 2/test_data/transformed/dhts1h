Hello, Song Agent! I have a unique request for you. Instead of finding a song based on the details I’m about to share, could you generate an original song that captures the same mood and features? Here’s what I’m envisioning:

- **Mood/Tone**: Low, droning instrumentals with an ethereal quality. The overall atmosphere should feel haunting yet beautiful.
- **Vocals**: A female vocalist whose style is almost like a chant—soft but commanding, adding to the otherworldly vibe.
- **Theme/Imagery**: Cinematic storytelling set at night. Think mysterious and surreal visuals:
  - Children in Victorian-style clothing being rowed down a dark river in a small boat.
  - A deserted mansion filled with remnants of an extravagant party—broken chandeliers, overturned tables—and lifeless bodies scattered around. Wild animals or dogs prowling through the wreckage.
  - The singer standing outside under moonlight, her face painted like a skull, exuding both melancholy and power.
  - At the end, the children are rowed away into the unknown.

Could you create something inspired by these elements? Let me know if anything needs clarification!
