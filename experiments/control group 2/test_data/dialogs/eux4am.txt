Hey there! I need you to generate a song for me. Here's what I'm thinking:  

It should have soft, memorable instrumentals that feel kind of nostalgic—maybe from the 70s or 80s? The singer is male, with a smooth and gentle tone, not too loud or aggressive. There’s one lyric I sort of remember, something like, “Won’t you come to me? Joanna,” though I’m pretty sure “Joanna” isn’t exactly right—it might be another word that rhymes or sounds similar, like “oh-anna.”  

Can you create something based on this vibe? Let me know how it turns out!

[verse]
Won't you come to me? Diana
In the night so weary

[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Let's go back to old Havana
Where the stars align in sweet surrender

[verse]
I remember those nights under neon lights
Dancing like no one’s watching

[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Take me back to that forgotten land
Where love was young and hearts were pounding

[bridge]
The world keeps spinning, but we can slow it down
Just you and me, lost in this melody

[chorus]
Oh, Diana, oh-anna
Let's fade away into tomorrow
With dreams of yesterday forevermore
