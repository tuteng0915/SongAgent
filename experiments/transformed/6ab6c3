Hey there! I’m looking to generate a song that matches some specific details. I want it to feel like something from the late 90s or early 2000s, with an alternative or grunge vibe. The song should have a memorable part where the singer—male, with a high-pitched voice—sings the phrase "controlling me." It would be awesome if the lyrics and overall mood could evoke that era's animation style (think edgy and otherworldly). Maybe even throw in some alien-related imagery for extra flavor? Let’s create something that captures this nostalgic yet mysterious essence!
