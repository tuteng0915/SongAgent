Lyrics :
[verse]
In the echoes of yesterday, I find my way
A shadowed path where memories lay
The sun sets quick, colors fade to gray
Longing for a moment that slipped away

[chorus]
Hold on to me, like whispers in the dark
We're chasing shadows, leaving marks
On this heart, torn apart, we carve our scars
Together we'll heal, under the stars
