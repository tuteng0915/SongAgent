Hey there! I understand you're looking for a song, but how about we create one instead? Based on your description, it sounds like you're after a powerful metal/rock track with clean vocals and an emotionally charged chorus. The vibe seems to align with bands like Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and Linkin Park—bands known for their heavy yet melodic sound.

Here’s my request:  
Can you generate a metal/rock song with clean vocals that has a chorus centered around themes of desperation or longing? Something along the lines of "Rescue me... [forgotten lyrics] ...I'm drowning." The tone should be intense and emotional, capturing that same heaviness found in alternative/nu-metal styles. Let's make it epic!

What do you think?
