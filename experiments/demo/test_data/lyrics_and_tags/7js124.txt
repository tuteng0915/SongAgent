Lyrics :
[Verse 1]
Riding through the night, chasing every dream
With the wind at our backs, we're breaking free
The open road calls, a ribbon of light
Underneath the starry sky, shining so bright

[Chorus]
We'll run like wildfire, hearts open wide
Dancing in the moonlight, with nothing to hide
Freedom's calling, hear it in the air
Together we'll conquer, everywhere

[Verse 2]
Footsteps echo louder, as we climb higher
Every heartbeat fuels the fire
The thrill of the journey, the beauty we find
In the vastness of the night, we leave behind

[Bridge]
In this journey, we find who we are
Guided by the stars, no matter how far

[Chorus]
We'll run like wildfire, hearts open wide
Dancing in the moonlight, with nothing to hide
Freedom's calling, hear it in the air
Together we'll conquer, everywhere
